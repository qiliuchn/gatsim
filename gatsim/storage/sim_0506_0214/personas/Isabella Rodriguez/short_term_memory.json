Socially, I spent some time with my friend Sophia Nguyen over the weekend, which was refreshing. Looking ahead, I am excited about the art exhibition at the Museum tomorrow, where Sophia and I plan to meet for a midday outing. I should also consider fitting in some exercise at the Gym this week, as it has been a few days since my last workout. Traffic around noon seems manageable, but I\u2019ll be mindful of congestion near popular spots like the Supermarket and Food court during peak hours.",
