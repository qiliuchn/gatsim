I enjoyed a quiet weekend practicing photography and cooking meals with Sophia. Looking ahead, I\u2019m excited about today\u2019s art exhibition at the Museum, which will be a nice change of pace. I\u2019ll also try to incorporate more walking into my routine, as I enjoy it and want to stay active. Traffic conditions in the morning peak hours have been manageable, but I should continue monitoring congestion around the Supermarket and Food court during late afternoons.",
