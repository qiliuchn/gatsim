I cycled frequently for short trips and drove when transporting baked goods. This week, I\u2019m looking forward to meeting my friend Isabella at the Museum for an art exhibition during lunch. I also plan to maintain my usual routine of early morning baking and yoga. Additionally, I should consider grocery shopping soon as our household supplies are running low. Traffic around midday seems manageable, but I\u2019ll need to keep an eye on congestion near the Museum during peak visiting hours.",
