I took the metro to work most days, which allowed me to enjoy some quiet time for photography planning and creative thinking. Sophia and I spent quality time together at home, cooking meals and discussing future plans. This Monday, I am looking forward to joining Sophia and Isabella at the Museum for the art exhibition. It will be a nice break from routine. Additionally, I should remember that the metro is often crowded during peak hours, so I\u2019ll aim to leave earlier to avoid congestion. The road traffic around the town tends to be heavier in the late afternoon, so I should plan my return trip accordingly.",
