I also need to carve out some personal time for relaxation and perhaps a visit to the Gym, as I\u2019ve been neglecting exercise due to work commitments. Traffic around midday seems manageable, but I should remain mindful of peak congestion times, particularly in the afternoon near the School and Supermarket zones.",
