The metro ride to the Hospital was reliable and safe, as expected during nighttime hours. After completing my shift, I took the metro back home without any issues. Overall, despite the early disruption, I was able to adapt and fulfill most of my planned activities. I learned that peak times at the Supermarket can be unpredictable and should include more buffer time for errands. Additionally, coordinating with Oliver in person at the Museum strengthened our shared time together.",

However, the unexpected 131-minute delay at the Supermarket due to midday congestion completely disrupted my schedule. I had to cancel the Museum visit and returned directly home to preserve rest time. While traffic was consistently uncongested and allowed for smooth travel, the lack of buffer in my original plan left no room for such disruptions. I realized that midday shopping at the Supermarket is riskier than anticipated, and future plans should either avoid it during those hours or include sufficient padding. Fortunately, I could adapt by simplifying the activity chain, which helped me still arrive home with enough time to prepare mentally and physically for my hospital shift.",
