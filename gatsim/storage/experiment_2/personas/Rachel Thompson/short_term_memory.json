Last week was relatively smooth in terms of commuting, though I noticed that morning traffic on Ave_3 can be unpredictable if I leave after 8:00 AM. I need to ensure I arrive at work on time since managing screenings and events requires early preparation. My son Daniel has school in the mornings, so coordinating drop-off and my commute is important. This week, I plan to organize our community movie night on Thursday evening, which will require some coordination with Isabella. I also want to make sure I get some exercise in\u2014maybe a quick walk or yoga session at the Gym later in the evening when it's less crowded.",
