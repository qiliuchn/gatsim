I managed to teach my weekend fitness class and volunteer at the senior center, which was rewarding. Jonathan and I coordinated drop-offs and pick-ups for our nephew who\u2019s staying with us temporarily. Travel-wise, I noticed that Ave_3 gets congested earlier than expected during weekday mornings, so I\u2019ve started leaving 15 minutes earlier to avoid delays. I also found that the Gym is much quieter before 7:00 AM, which fits well with my morning runs. Looking ahead, I plan to maintain this early schedule to stay consistent with both work and health goals. I\u2019ll also need to coordinate with Benjamin and Robert on upcoming wellness programs later in the week.",

I will take St_4_link_2 followed by Ave_3_link_3 to reach Node_2 (Factory). The current traffic conditions show moderate delays on parts of St_1, but my revised path avoids the most affected areas. My husband Jonathan is taking transit to work as originally planned since I was unable to drop him off due to my own adjusted schedule.

The meeting started at 18:15 as planned and has been going smoothly. Since there's no congestion in the network and my husband Jonathan is already at the Gym for an extended workout session with Ahmed Hassan, there\u2019s no urgency to leave early. The discussion with Benjamin is productive, and we\u2019re coordinating well with our shared goals involving Robert Johnson later in the week. With the current traffic conditions being clear and my schedule allowing flexibility after this meeting, I can extend the discussion slightly without concern.\nPlan revisions: Rebecca Lee update the departure time of next activity at Uptown apartment to 19:00 ",
