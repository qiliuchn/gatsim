I coordinated with Gloria Campbell to set up the exhibition space, and it was a great success. Ahmed and I also spent time with Zara, helping her prepare for the upcoming school science fair. On Saturday, we visited the Amusement Park in the afternoon, but found heavy congestion around 18:00 on Ave_3, which delayed our return home. I need to be more mindful of peak travel times this week. Today is Monday, so I have to ensure I drop Zara off at School before heading to Factory for my 8:00 shift. I also plan to stop by my coffee shop briefly in the evening after work if time permits. This week, I aim to balance my managerial responsibilities at the Factory with supporting my daughter\u2019s school events and continuing to host small cultural gatherings at the coffee shop.",

The event was a highlight of the week, aligning with my passion for promoting cultural awareness and community bonding. On Monday, Ahmed and I coordinated drop-off and pickup times for Zara to avoid morning congestion near the Hospital, which worked well. However, I noticed delays on Ave_3_link_1 and St_2_link_1 during the morning commute, which slightly disrupted my schedule. I adjusted by revising my route early, ensuring minimal impact on my work start time. Evening errands were smooth, though returning home experienced light congestion on Ave_2_link_2. This week, I aim to maintain this proactive approach to traffic adjustments while balancing my roles at work, home, and in the community. I also plan to continue supporting Isabella with sourcing strategies and collaborate with Gloria Campbell on upcoming exhibitions.",
