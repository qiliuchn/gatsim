Last weekend, I spent some time cycling around town, which was both enjoyable and a great way to stay active. This week, I need to focus on my work deliverables as a mid-quarter review is approaching. I also want to make sure I maintain a good balance by attending my usual yoga class at the Gym and catching up with friends. The traffic patterns in the morning seem predictable, with Ave_3 often busier than Ave_2. I should avoid those congested routes and plan accordingly. On the social front, Emma mentioned during our last meetup that she\u2019s interested in collaborating on another data visualization project, so I\u2019ll reach out later this week to coordinate. Since it's Monday, I expect a typical flow of meetings and tasks today.",
