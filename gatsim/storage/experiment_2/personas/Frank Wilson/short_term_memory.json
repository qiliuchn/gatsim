Throughout the day, I remained proactive in adjusting departure times to avoid anticipated congestion around 19:15 at the Factory\u2019s parking area. Despite these efforts, a misaligned trip back toward Midtown caused some inefficiency, likely due to outdated routing logic still factoring in old activity intentions. The moderate congestion on St_1_link_2 added a few minutes of delay, but overall, the revised route choices kept me reasonably on schedule. On a personal level, the constant need for plan revisions was mentally taxing, though it reinforced the importance of staying adaptable and responsive to real-time updates. Tomorrow, I\u2019ll benefit from clearer early communication with Hannah about her evening plans to streamline my own schedule.",

Persistent congestion on St_1_link_2 caused significant delays throughout the evening, requiring me to reassess travel paths multiple times. Despite these disruptions, I managed to adapt by updating departure times, rerouting efficiently, and prioritizing punctuality for my night shift. Coordination with Hannah remained strong despite the shifting plans, and while I missed some intended stops like Coffee shop, I maintained flexibility and safety-focused decision-making. The long delays on St_1_link_2 were the most impactful issue of the day, affecting both personal and professional commitments.

I need to drop Hannah at Food court by 7:20 AM and take the car to Factory starting at 19:00. Hannah will walk back to Midtown apartment after work and attend Gym around 19:00, leaving by 20:30. I will pick her up from Midtown apartment around 20:30. There is moderate congestion on St_1_link_2 (Node_9 \u2192 Node_13) with a wait time of 5 minutes, which aligns with our previous plan to avoid St_1_link_2 in the evening to prevent delays.\nPlan revisions: Frank Wilson update future activity plan:\n[['Food court', '07:20', 20, 'drive', 'St_2_link_1, Ave_2_link_2', 'Drop off Hannah at Food court by 7:20 AM before heading to Factory.'], ['Factory', '19:00', 120, 'drive', 'Ave_2_link_3, St_4_link_2', 'Begin night shift at Factory at 19:00, supervising production and ensuring safety protocols are followed.'], ['Midtown apartment', '20:30', 60, 'drive', 'shortest', 'Pick up Hannah from Midtown apartment around 20:30 after she finishes her Gym activity.'], ['Midtown apartment', '05:30', 'none', 'drive', 'shortest', 'Return home after finishing night shift and prepare for rest.']] \n\nTime: 07:20\nReflections: \nCurrent traffic conditions show severe congestion on St_1_link_1 (Node_4 \u2192 Node_9) with a wait time of 11 minutes, which is the route Hannah would take to get to Food court by 7:20 AM. Since Hannah will be walking back to Midtown apartment after work and attending Gym around 19:00, it makes sense for me to drive directly to Factory without dropping her off at Food court this morning. This avoids unnecessary delays and aligns with our coordinated plan from 07:00 where I was already scheduled to drop her off before heading to Factory. Adjusting now ensures I arrive at Factory on time without being impacted by the heavy congestion.\nPlan revisions: Frank Wilson update future activity plan:\n[['Factory', '07:30', 120, 'drive', 'St_1_link_1, St_1_link_2', 'Head directly to Factory avoiding Food court drop-off due to severe congestion on St_1_link_1.'], ['Midtown apartment', '20:30', 60, 'drive', 'shortest', 'Pick up Hannah from Midtown apartment around 20:30 after she finishes her Gym activity.'], ['Midtown apartment', '05:30', 'none', 'drive', 'shortest', 'Return home after finishing night shift and prepare for rest.']] \n\nTime: 17:30\nReflections: \nI've just finished my work shift at the Factory and am now considering my plans for the evening.
