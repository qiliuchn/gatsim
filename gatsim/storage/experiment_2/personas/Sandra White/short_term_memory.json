In the evening, heading to the Gym for yoga, I encountered unexpected heavy congestion on Ave_4_link_1, forcing another reroute via St_1_link_2 and Ave_3_link_1. This delay impacted my plans to meet Maria Lopez, requiring rescheduling and causing frustration. Overall, coordination with Kevin ensured smooth family logistics, and I still managed to maintain my health routine despite transportation challenges.

Since it's 15:00, I should be picking up Grace from School according to my original plan. The traffic is currently clear with no congestion on any roads, which makes this an optimal time to travel. My previous reflection mentioned coordinating with Kevin for Grace's pickup, with me handling evening activities by car. Given that there are no unexpected events or traffic issues affecting my route, I can proceed as originally planned.\nPlan revisions: Sandra White update future activity plan:\n[['School', '15:00', 20, 'drive', 'St_3_link_1, Ave_2_link_2', 'Pick up Grace from School after shift ends; coordinate timing to allow for potential traffic delays.'], ['Gym', 'none', 60, 'drive', 'shortest', 'Head to Gym for evening yoga session with Maria Lopez; optimal time based on previous attendance insights.'], ['Midtown apartment', '20:00', 'none', 'drive', 'shortest', 'Return home after yoga; spend evening with family and prepare for upcoming day.']] \n\nTime: 15:22\nReflections: \nAt 15:22, I'm currently en route from the Factory to pick up Grace from School. According to my revised plan at 15:00, I should be arriving at School shortly. Kevin has also adjusted his schedule to handle Grace's pickup at 15:15 as per his current activity status. This indicates that there may be some overlap or redundancy in our plans for school pickup. However, traffic is completely clear with no congestion reported on any roads, so both of us reaching the School isn't causing any transportation issues. Given this situation, it would be efficient for me to coordinate with Kevin to avoid both of us picking up Grace unnecessarily. Since Kevin is already en route and planning to arrive at 15:15, and I'm arriving slightly later than planned, it makes sense for me to adjust my schedule to focus on our evening wellness routine together at the Gym instead of duplicating efforts for the pickup.\nPlan revisions: Sandra White update future activity plan:\n[['Gym', '16:00', 60, 'drive', 'shortest', 'Head to Gym for evening yoga session with Maria Lopez and include Grace for family wellness time.'], ['Midtown apartment', '19:30', 'none', 'drive', 'shortest', 'Return home after family yoga session; spend evening with family and prepare for upcoming day.']] \n\nTime: 15:31\nReflections: \nKevin is already en route to pick up Grace from School with an arrival time of 15:15, and I am currently traveling from the Factory toward Node_5 (School).

Since traffic remains completely clear with no congestion on any roads, there is no urgency for me to rush elsewhere. Our prior coordination established that we would meet at the Gym around 16:00 for a family wellness session, which aligns well with my current timeline. There\u2019s no need for further plan revisions since the updated activity plan from 15:22 already reflects this arrangement. I should depart for the Gym shortly to arrive by 16:00 and join Kevin, Grace, and potentially others like Sarah Chen who is also at the Gym.\nPlan revisions: Sandra White update the departure time of next activity at Gym to 16:00 ",
