This will delay my commute and potentially cause me to arrive late for my 10:00 shift at Supermarket. Paul is also coordinating with me due to these conditions, and we've agreed I should leave by 7:45 AM while he departs at 7:55 AM to ensure both of us arrive on time. Lisa is currently delayed on Ave_2_link_1 as well, suggesting potential secondary congestion impacts.\nPlan revisions: Michelle Harris update the departure time of next activity at Supermarket to 07:45 \n\nTime: 07:30\nReflections: \nCurrent traffic conditions show severe congestion on St_1_link_2 (Node_9 \u2192 Node_13) with 11 minutes of wait time, which affects the planned path from Midtown apartment to Supermarket. My original plan was to drive via St_1_link_1 and St_1_link_2, but due to this bottleneck, I need to adjust my route to avoid delays. Additionally, Lisa is experiencing delays on Ave_2_link_1, suggesting potential congestion there as well. Since Paul and I already coordinated earlier to leave by 7:45 AM, I will re-route to minimize travel time and ensure punctuality for my 10:00 AM shift.\nPlan revisions: Michelle Harris update current path to ['Ave_2_link_1', 'Ave_2_link_2'] ",
