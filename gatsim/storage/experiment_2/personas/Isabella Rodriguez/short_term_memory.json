Last week was busy at the coffee shop managing customer traffic and staff coordination, but I managed to keep up with my morning yoga and catch up with friends over the weekend. I noticed that some roads near the museum and the school tend to get congested in the mornings, so I'll need to plan accordingly this week.

The absence of congestion means I can proceed with the original plan without needing detours or timing adjustments. My schedule aligns well with the revised chats: meeting Gloria at the Museum in the morning before heading to work, and later meeting Michael at the Coffee shop after gym and shopping.
