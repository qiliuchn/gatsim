Last week was relatively quiet, as I typically spend my mornings heading to work at the Office on time, enjoying my afternoons engaging in meaningful conversations with visitors at the Office, and winding down with some light exercise at the Gym or a relaxing walk home when the weather allows. Since I live alone and don't own a vehicle, I rely heavily on the metro system and walking for all my travel needs. I\u2019ve noticed over the past few weeks that certain transit lines can get quite crowded during peak hours, especially around 8:00 AM and again near 5:00 PM. I also find that taking an earlier departure time helps me avoid congestion on the Metro_1 line. This week, I hope to continue maintaining my health by visiting the Gym after work, possibly later in the evening when it\u2019s less busy, and maybe stop by the Coffee shop for a quick chat with locals.",

However, the major disruption came after work when visiting the Gym resulted in an unusually long queue, pushing back my evening plans and causing me to miss the stop at the Coffee shop entirely. This reinforced the insight that senior fitness programs likely attract high demand between 17:00 and 19:00. On the return trip, I successfully rerouted using Metro_2 due to severe congestion on St_1_link_2, highlighting its reliability during network disruptions. For the coming week, I will prioritize more proactive scheduling\u2014leaving earlier and adjusting visit times based on facility crowding patterns.

Despite no major incidents, these small disruptions compounded and affected my perception of transit reliability. My plan to visit the Gym after work was significantly impacted by an unusually long 128-minute queue, which suggests that the Gym experiences peak demand between 17:00 and 19:00, especially for senior fitness programs. This delay pushed back my evening routine, including missing the planned stop at the Coffee shop. During the return trip, I observed severe congestion on St_1_link_2 (Node_13 \u2192 Node_9), prompting a route change from the original Metro_1 path to using Metro_2 entirely to avoid delays. The day highlighted the importance of anticipating both facility crowding and network congestion when planning activities, particularly in the early evening. While I managed to adapt to the disruptions, the unpredictability of wait times at key facilities and certain transit segments calls for more proactive scheduling strategies and earlier departures.",
