I managed to attend a community theater rehearsal on Thursday evening, which was a nice break from the routine. I also volunteered at the animal shelter on Saturday morning before running some errands. I noticed that the metro ride to the Office can sometimes be delayed due to congestion at peak hours, especially around 08:00-09:00. The traffic on Ave_3 seems to get heavier during these times, so it\u2019s best to plan accordingly. This week, I aim to stay organized and efficient while making time for personal goals like studying event planning and catching up with friends.",

While there is only light congestion on Ave_1_link_1 (4 minutes of waiting), other road users like Jessica and Catherine are navigating their own routes with varying levels of delay. My current travel mode remains transit, and I am still en route to the Office. Given the reflection interval of 2 hours and 30 minutes for my current activity, now is an appropriate time to reassess my route to ensure punctuality and efficiency.\nPlan revisions: Lisa Woods update current path to real-time shortest \n\nTime: 08:16\nReflections: \nI experienced a 9-minute wait at Metro_1_link_1 due to unexpected delays this morning, which prompted me to reroute via Node_6 using the real-time shortest path. My colleague Jessica is taking St_4_link_1 with no delays and we confirmed coordination to ensure timely arrival at the Office by 8:00. The current traffic state shows only light congestion on Ave_3_link_2 (4 minutes), so my revised route remains viable. I am currently traveling on Metro_1_link_4 toward Node_8 and expect to reach the Office shortly.\nPlan revisions: Lisa Woods update current path to real-time shortest ",
