Karen and I have coordinated drop-offs and pick-ups for Noah and Mia, which seems to be working well. I picked up Mia from Gym last evening, and she mentioned wanting to go back after school again this week. This week looks like it will follow a similar rhythm\u2014work during the day, family time in the evenings. I should keep an eye on travel times and avoid peak congestion areas when possible.",
