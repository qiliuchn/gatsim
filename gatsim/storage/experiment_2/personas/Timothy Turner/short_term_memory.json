I am currently on Ave_3_link_3 after entering from Ave_3_link_2 and Ave_3_link_1. The current traffic state shows moderate congestion on Ave_2_link_1 (8 min wait) and light congestion on St_2_link_1 (4 min wait). From yesterday's experience and today's chat with Robert Hayes, I know that St_1_link_2 has been problematic, so it's wise to continue avoiding it. I've adjusted my arrival time to the Office to around 8:45 AM as coordinated with Robert Hayes.\nPlan revisions: Timothy Turner update future activity plan:\n[['Office', '08:45', 120, 'drive', 'Ave_3_link_3', 'Arrive at Office by 8:45 AM to prepare for logistics coordination meeting with Robert Hayes scheduled later than originally planned due to traffic adjustments.'], ['Supermarket', '12:15', 60, 'drive', 'Ave_2_link_2, St_3_link_1', 'Head to Supermarket during lunch break to stock up on essentials; plan to arrive earlier than yesterday to avoid potential queues.'], ['Office', '13:00', 120, 'drive', 'St_3_link_1, Ave_2_link_2', 'Return to Office after grocery run to resume afternoon tasks including collaboration session with Jonathan Lee.'], ['Coffee shop', '14:30', 60, 'drive', 'Ave_3_link_2, Ave_3_link_1', 'Meet Amanda at Coffee shop between 14:00 and 15:00 for a coffee break as per our agreement; discuss any changes in plans.'], ['Gym', '17:30', 60, 'drive', 'shortest', 'Go to Gym for regular evening workout session after work; aiming to improve consistency in personal fitness routine despite possible congestion on Ave_4_link_1.'], ['Midtown apartment', '19:00', 'none', 'drive', 'shortest', 'Drive back home to Midtown apartment and prepare dinner with Amanda before reviewing logistics plans for next week.']] \n\nTime: 12:15\nReflections: \nI am currently at the Office, having arrived at 8:45 AM after adjusting my morning commute due to earlier traffic concerns. The current traffic state shows no congestion across the network, which is a positive development compared to recent days. This lack of congestion suggests that my usual routes may now be viable without delays. My wife Amanda has already arrived at the Cinema for her shift, and I note that Jonathan Lee and Steven Robinson are also at the Office, which supports staying on-site for collaborative work over lunch. Given this, I can consider extending my time here before heading to the Supermarket as planned.\nPlan revisions: Timothy Turner update the departure time of next activity at Supermarket to 12:30 \n\nTime: 12:40\nReflections: \nCurrently on Ave_3_link_3 heading to Supermarket, moderate congestion with 8 min wait detected. Amanda is also en route to Supermarket from Cinema via St_3_link_2, and we coordinated an earlier meetup at Coffee shop at 14:15 instead of the originally planned 14:30. Given this plan adjustment, I should re-evaluate my current trip to Supermarket and consider proceeding directly to Coffee shop to align with Amanda\u2019s revised schedule.\nPlan revisions: Timothy Turner update future activity plan:\n[['Coffee shop', '13:10', 60, 'drive', 'Ave_3_link_2', 'Meet Amanda at Coffee shop by 14:15 as per earlier coordination; adjust departure time to 13:10 to allow sufficient travel time avoiding Ave_3_link_3 congestion.'], ['Office', '15:00', 120, 'drive', 'shortest', 'Return to Office after coffee meetup for afternoon tasks including collaboration session with Jonathan Lee.'], ['Gym', '17:30', 60, 'drive', 'shortest', 'Go to Gym for regular evening workout session after work.'], ['Midtown apartment', '19:00', 'none', 'drive', 'shortest', 'Drive back home to Midtown apartment and prepare dinner with Amanda.']] \n\nTime: 12:58\nReflections: \nI am currently en route to the Supermarket from the Office, but Amanda is also arriving there shortly as we coordinated an earlier meetup at the Coffee shop. Since both of us are heading to the same destination, it makes sense to bypass the Supermarket entirely and proceed directly to the Coffee shop to save time and avoid unnecessary travel.

The traffic state remains clear with no congestion detected on any road links, which supports efficient travel. Since we are both already traveling on Ave_3_link_2 and will arrive shortly, there is no need for further modifications to our meetup time or location. Additionally, Robert Hayes has confirmed he will join us at the Coffee shop around 15:20, so after our meetup with Amanda concludes, I should remain available to engage in the logistics discussion with him.\nPlan revisions: Timothy Turner update future activity plan:\n[['Coffee shop', '14:15', 60, 'drive', 'Ave_3_link_2', 'Meet Amanda at Coffee shop by 14:15 as coordinated.'], ['Coffee shop', '15:30', 120, 'drive', 'none', 'Engage in logistics discussion with Robert Hayes at Coffee shop until approximately 15:30.'], ['Office', '15:45', 120, 'drive', 'shortest', 'Return to Office after meetup to resume afternoon tasks including collaboration session with Jonathan Lee.'], ['Gym', '17:30', 60, 'drive', 'shortest', 'Go to Gym for regular evening workout session after work.'], ['Midtown apartment', '19:00', 'none', 'drive', 'shortest', 'Drive back home to Midtown apartment and prepare dinner with Amanda before reviewing logistics plans for next week.']] \n\nTime: 15:30\nReflections: \nRobert Hayes has rescheduled our logistics discussion at the Coffee shop to 15:40 due to his delay from the Gym. Since I am currently at the Coffee shop with Amanda and traffic conditions are clear, I can easily accommodate this change without disrupting my schedule. There is no congestion affecting any road links, so I will simply extend my stay here until Robert arrives. This adjustment allows for continued conversation with Amanda while waiting for Robert's arrival.\nPlan revisions: Timothy Turner update future activity plan:\n[['Coffee shop', '15:40', 60, 'drive', 'none', 'Engage in logistics discussion with Robert Hayes at Coffee shop around 15:40 after he finishes at the Gym.'], ['Office', '16:30', 120, 'drive', 'shortest', 'Return to Office by 16:30 to resume afternoon tasks including collaboration session with Jonathan Lee.'], ['Gym', '17:30', 60, 'drive', 'shortest', 'Go to Gym for regular evening workout session after work.'], ['Midtown apartment', '19:00', 'none', 'drive', 'shortest', 'Drive back home to Midtown apartment and prepare dinner with Amanda before reviewing logistics plans for next week.']] \n\nTime: 15:34\nReflections: \nCurrently at the Coffee shop with Amanda, and Robert Hayes is rescheduled to arrive at 15:40 for a logistics discussion. The traffic state remains clear across all links, which allows for smooth travel later in the day. Since I'm already here and there's no congestion affecting my schedule, I can comfortably extend my stay until Robert arrives. This delay also provides additional time to coordinate with Amanda before returning to the Office.

The traffic state shows light congestion (4-minute wait) on Ave_3_link_3, which affects my current travel time slightly, but does not require a reroute. Steven Robinson is also on this link with an 8-minute delay, likely contributing to the congestion. Amanda is en route via metro and will walk from Node_3 to the Gym. Given the light congestion and that both Amanda and I are still on track to reach the Gym by ~17:45, no immediate plan changes are necessary. However, considering that Robert Hayes will be at the Office by 18:00 for coordination, it makes sense to adjust my post-Gym destination to ensure timely arrival at the Office.\nPlan revisions: Timothy Turner update future activity plan:\n[['Gym', '17:40', 60, 'drive', 'St_4_link_2, Ave_4_link_1', 'Continue to Gym for regular evening workout session; slight delay due to light congestion on Ave_3_link_3.'], ['Office', '18:30', 120, 'drive', 'Ave_4_link_1, St_1_link_2', 'Head to Office after Gym to meet Robert Hayes for end-of-day logistics coordination, aiming to arrive before 19:00.'], ['Midtown apartment', '19:30', 'none', 'drive', 'shortest', 'Drive back home to Midtown apartment and prepare dinner with Amanda.']] \n\nTime: 17:49\nReflections: \nI am currently on St_4_link_2 heading to the Gym after departing from the Office at 17:30 as planned.

Steven Robinson and Jonathan Lee are also en route to the Gym, with Steven experiencing an 8-minute delay due to earlier congestion.
