I noticed that Ave_3_link_3 and St_4_link_2 were particularly useful alternatives during evening disruptions, which gives me confidence in planning alternative routes when needed. This week, I want to continue optimizing my schedule by balancing driving and transit based on time-of-day traffic patterns. I also need to ensure I\u2019m not falling behind on personal wellness goals and should consider midday or early afternoon exercise options if possible. Looking ahead, I should stay mindful of how unexpected events\u2014like an urgent project update\u2014can shift my schedule, and build in flexibility accordingly.",

During transit back home, I considered alternative walking routes based on Ahmed Hassan\u2019s movements, which showed potential time savings.
