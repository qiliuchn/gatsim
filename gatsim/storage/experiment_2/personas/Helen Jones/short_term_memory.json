I noticed that during morning hours, the central part of town gets busier around 8:00 AM, especially near Node_6 and Node_10 due to transit transfers. The metro is generally reliable but can get crowded during peak times. Looking ahead, I plan to balance work, light exercise, and a scheduled evening meeting with Gloria at the Coffee shop.",

Throughout the evening, I faced repeated challenges due to recurring congestion on St_1_link_2, which I ultimately bypassed by switching to Metro_2_link_4 and Metro_2_link_5. Although I delayed my departure from the Gym multiple times monitoring traffic, I learned that historical patterns of congestion are often more predictive than real-time data alone. My reliance on public transit and walking requires proactive route planning rather than reactive adjustments.

The trip to the Supermarket took longer than expected, which means I might be slightly behind schedule for the rest of the day. However, there are no traffic issues currently affecting the network, so my travel options remain flexible. Gloria Campbell has just completed her work shift at the Factory and is likely available for a meeting. Given this, I should consider adjusting my departure time from the Supermarket to meet her at the Coffee shop as originally planned.\nPlan revisions: Helen Jones update the departure time of next activity at Gym to 17:30 \n\nTime: 17:31\nReflections: \nI have just left the Supermarket and am preparing to head to the Gym.
