I've been making sure to balance my time between engineering projects at the Office and supporting Zara\u2019s school activities. Fatima and I coordinated drop-off and pickup schedules for Zarty, which has gone smoothly so far. I noticed that morning traffic on Ave_3 tends to get congested around 07:30, so I\u2019ve started adjusting my departure times accordingly. On a personal level, I\u2019ve been trying to stay more active by visiting the Gym after work, but it's often crowded during peak hours. This coming week, I plan to explore alternative routes to avoid congestion, possibly using the metro system more frequently to reduce travel stress and support my sustainability goals.",

Traffic conditions later in the day, particularly the severe congestion on St_1_link_2 during evening commute, reinforced the importance of route awareness and adaptive planning.
