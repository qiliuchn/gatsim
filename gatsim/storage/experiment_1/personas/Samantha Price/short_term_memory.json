I also mentored a few junior engineers, which was fulfilling. On the weekend, I enjoyed a road trip to explore nearby towns, which helped me unwind. This week, I plan to maintain that balance\u2014staying focused during work hours while ensuring I make time for yoga in the evenings and catch up with Nina later in the week.

My planned path included St_2_link_2 and St_1_link_2 to reach the Factory. However, I just received real-time traffic updates indicating that St_1_link_1 is under severe congestion with a 16-minute wait time. Although my current trajectory does not directly involve St_1_link_1, it\u2019s part of the broader network flow and could potentially impact return trips or future routing flexibility later in the day. Given this, I should consider updating my outbound path slightly to preemptively avoid potential ripple effects from the congestion on adjacent links.\nPlan revisions: Samantha Price update current path to ['Ave_4', 'St_4', 'Ave_3'] \nTime: 17:49\nReflections: \nI am currently at the Gym, finishing my yoga session. However, there is moderate congestion (8-minute wait) on Ave_4_link_1, which I will need to traverse when heading to the Coffee shop to meet Nina Scott. Based on previous experiences and current traffic conditions, this delay may push my arrival time past our planned 18:45 meeting. I have already coordinated with Nina, who is arriving early and will wait for me until 19:00. Given that I'm still within a reasonable window to make the meeting, I will slightly adjust my departure time to allow for the delay and message Nina when I approach Node_11.\nPlan revisions:\nSamantha Price update the departure time of next activity at Coffee shop to 18:10\n",
