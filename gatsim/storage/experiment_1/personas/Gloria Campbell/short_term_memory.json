I managed to stay on top of personal goals like attending a cultural event with Fatima last weekend, but I haven't had much time for exercise or reading lately. Gloria\u2019s household is small and uncomplicated, which makes scheduling easier, though coordinating occasional social meetups like book clubs with Patricia requires planning around travel times and availability. Traffic patterns have been consistent\u2014Ave_3 tends to be busier during morning commutes, and the Factory area gets congested by 7:45 AM as workers arrive. I\u2019ve learned to leave early enough to avoid delays. Looking ahead this week, I hope to find some time later in the evenings for reading and possibly schedule a meetup with friends after work if traffic allows.",
