During lunch, I noticed that returning to work would be affected by light congestion on Ave_3_link_2, so I adjusted my return path accordingly. I also managed to visit the Museum as planned, which was both relaxing and enriching. However, I realized I needed to adjust my evening plans slightly\u2014moving my Gym session up to 16:15 allowed me to maintain my routine without rushing later.

While this significantly delayed my evening plans, coordination with Isabella and Ashley allowed for a shared social experience that made the wait worthwhile.
