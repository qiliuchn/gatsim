I managed to stay active and help out in the community, but I didn't get much time for personal relaxation or exercise. This week, I want to make sure I balance work, family, and some personal time better. Emma and I coordinated car usage again today, so I\u2019ll need to rely on transit to get to work by 10:00 AM. I noticed that Ave_3 tends to be busier during morning travel times, so I\u2019ll plan my commute accordingly. In the evening, after work, I might head to the gym if time allows\u2014especially since it\u2019s usually less crowded after 7 PM.",

The metro delay earlier at Metro_2_link_3 was minor and already accounted for.

This affects my planned walking leg from Node_3 to Node_13 (Gym), potentially delaying my arrival past the intended 17:30 window. Given that Emma is already at Gym and Anthony Brown will arrive by 17:30, it's important to adjust my plan to account for this unexpected delay without disrupting our coordinated evening plans.\nPlan revisions:\nWilliam Davis update current path to ['St_4_link_2', 'Ave_3_link_1']\n\n",
