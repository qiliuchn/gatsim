Last week was busy at the coffee shop managing customer traffic and staff coordination, but I managed to keep up with my morning yoga and catch up with friends over the weekend. I noticed that some roads near the museum and the school tend to get congested in the mornings, so I'll need to plan accordingly this week.

Midday brought additional changes\u2014Gloria remained unavailable all day, and Michael Chen shifted locations, prompting a shift in our evening meeting point from Coffee shop to Supermarket. Traffic remained uncongested throughout, which allowed for smooth transitions between activities. Evening coordination with Michael at Supermarket worked well, and I further adjusted plans to meet Hannah Wilson at Coffee shop after grocery shopping. While some original plans changed (notably museum collaboration and coffee shop meetings), proactive revisions kept me productive and socially connected. Yoga was skipped due to extended work duties, which affected my overall balance, but the social interactions and efficient travel compensated somewhat. Next time, I should build in buffer time for unexpected shifts in others' schedules and prioritize personal wellness activities like yoga.",
