I managed to attend a community theater rehearsal on Thursday evening, which was a nice break from the routine. I also volunteered at the animal shelter on Saturday morning before running some errands. I noticed that the metro ride to the Office can sometimes be delayed due to congestion at peak hours, especially around 08:00-09:00. The traffic on Ave_3 seems to get heavier during these times, so it\u2019s best to plan accordingly. This week, I aim to stay organized and efficient while making time for personal goals like studying event planning and catching up with friends.",
