I\u2019ve also realized that arriving at the Office just before 8:00 gives me a few minutes to prepare before starting the day's tasks. On the positive side, I managed to take short walks during lunch breaks, which supports my health goals. This week, I should stay alert for any unexpected traffic changes and consider visiting the Gym after work on a couple of days if time allows.",

Since my current travel mode is by car and I am still at home, it makes sense to adjust my route to minimize delays and ensure punctuality while maintaining coordination with Timothy.\nPlan revisions: Robert Hayes update current path to ['St_2', 'Ave_3'] \n\nTime: 07:50\nReflections: \nI am currently en route to the Coffee shop and have already adjusted my path earlier this morning to avoid congestion on Ave_2_link_2 and St_1_link_1 in coordination with Timothy Turner. At 07:50, I am at Node_5 after experiencing a 10-minute wait on St_2_link_1. My current planned path continues through Ave_3_link_1 (Node_9\u2192Node_10), which is under severe congestion with a 12-minute wait time. This delay could affect my arrival time at the Coffee shop, potentially pushing it beyond our intended meeting time of 08:30.
