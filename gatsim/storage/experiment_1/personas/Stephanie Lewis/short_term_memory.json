Last week, I dedicated time to managing pharmacy operations at the Factory and resumed my studies in healthcare management with Maria Lopez. I also practiced rehabilitation techniques with Rebecca Lee, which has been rewarding. I\u2019ve noticed that morning commutes can be smoother if I leave just before 7:30 AM, avoiding any potential congestion on Ave_2. Since I don\u2019t drive, I rely on walking and the metro system, and I\u2019ve found Metro_1 to be reliable for reaching the central commercial area. I plan to continue incorporating walks into my daily schedule, especially after work, to stay healthy and enjoy nature. This week, I aim to balance work, study sessions with friends, and some recreational activities like visiting the museum or gym in the evenings.",

Severe congestion on Ave_2_link_2 (Node_5 \u2192 Node_6) with a 16-minute wait time may impact the next leg of my transit journey. While this delay could affect my arrival time at work, I am still early in my commute and can reassess before proceeding further along the planned path. Since I cannot drive and must rely on public transit, rerouting options are limited to available metro lines. My revised departure at 07:35 gave me a few extra minutes to evaluate traffic updates, which is proving useful now. Given that Maria Lopez is also navigating congestion on St_2_link_2, it reinforces that this area is currently problematic.\nPlan revisions: Stephanie Lewis update current path to ['Metro_1_link_2', 'Metro_2_link_1', 'Metro_2_link_2'] \n\nTime: 07:58\nReflections: \nI am currently en route to the Factory via transit and have just arrived at Node_6. There is severe congestion on Ave_2_link_2 (Node_5 \u2192 Node_6) with a 16-minute wait time, which has already impacted my initial planned metro path. However, I rerouted earlier using Metro_2_link_1 and Metro_2_link_2, which are performing better. Since I\u2019m already navigating an adjusted path and my current location is Node_6, continuing along the revised plan should allow me to reach the Factory on time without further disruptions. Maria Lopez is also managing her commute via St_2_link_2 and expects to arrive at the Hospital by 8:00, confirming no expected delays for our evening study session.\nPlan revisions: Stephanie Lewis update current path to ['Metro_2_link_3', 'Metro_2_link_4', 'Metro_2_link_5'] Time: 12:49\nReflections:\nThe current traffic state shows no road congestion, which is a positive sign for my return trip to the Factory after lunch. However, I noticed that Rebecca Lee is currently at the Factory, and Maria Lopez is at the Hospital. This makes me consider potential coordination opportunities or updates we could share regarding afternoon transit conditions. Since I am at Node_11 (Coffee shop node) and already slightly delayed due to waiting 9 minutes at Metro_2_link_5, it\u2019s important to ensure I reach Node_6 (Supermarket) on time to complete my shopping before heading back to work. The absence of road congestion also means alternative routes might be viable later, especially if I decide to adjust my post-Supermarket travel.\nPlan revisions:\nStephanie Lewis update current path to ['Metro_2_link_3']\n\n\nTime: 13:30\nReflections: \nI have successfully completed my grocery shopping at the Supermarket, including picking up almond milk for Maria Lopez as discussed. The current traffic state shows no congestion, which means my return trip to the Factory via Metro_2_link_3 is expected to be smooth. Since I am on a lunch break and still within the planned time window, there is no need to make major changes to my schedule. I should leave soon to ensure I return to work on time and continue with the rest of my day as planned.\nPlan revisions:\nStephanie Lewis update the departure time of next activity at Coffee shop to 14:00\n",
