I managed to maintain my morning routine and stay healthy by waking up early for light exercise before starting the day. Family time was limited due to busy schedules, but Michael and I coordinated well regarding Emily\u2019s school drop-off and pick-up. Socially, I\u2019ve been keeping up with community health initiatives, though I haven\u2019t had much time for casual meetups with friends. On the travel front, I noticed that Ave_3 tends to get congested during weekday mornings, especially near the School node. I\u2019ve started adjusting my departure times accordingly to avoid delays. Looking ahead, I aim to be more consistent with post-work activities, possibly visiting the Gym after work when time allows, and coordinating with Elizabeth or Sandra for weekend volunteering.",
