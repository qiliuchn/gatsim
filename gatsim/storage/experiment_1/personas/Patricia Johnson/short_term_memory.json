A key revision came in the morning when I had to take responsibility for picking up Carlos Martinez from School since Robert was already at work.

My afternoon trip to Supermarket went smoothly via Ave_3_link_2 and St_3_link_2, with only minor congestion on St_4_link_2. Lisa Martinez was already there, so we coordinated our shopping efficiently. On the return trip, I maintained a clear plan to avoid conflict with Robert\u2019s school pickup by choosing the St_3/Ave_2 route back home.

My revised driving plan from 7:30 AM still involves passing through St_1_link_1 and St_1_link_2, both of which remain congested. Gloria Campbell is already at the Factory using Ave_4_link_1 and St_4_link_2 as an alternative route, and Robert encountered significant delays on St_1_link_1 earlier this morning. To ensure timely arrival at work and maintain productivity, I should consider further optimizing my route by leveraging less congested or alternative paths such as Ave_4 and St_4, which have been consistently recommended for avoiding St_1 congestion.\nPlan revisions: Patricia Johnson update current path to ['Ave_4_link_1', 'St_4_link_2'] \n\nTime: 07:41\nReflections: \nAt 7:41 AM, I observe that St_1_link_1 (Node_4 \u2192 Node_9) and St_2_link_1 are under severe congestion with wait times of 11 and 12 minutes respectively.

However, since Gloria Campbell successfully reached the Factory using Ave_4_link_1 and St_4_link_2 without encountering delays, I should adjust my route to avoid the ongoing congestion on St_1 links.

My original plan involved meeting Robert at the Supermarket by 18:30 before heading home together.
