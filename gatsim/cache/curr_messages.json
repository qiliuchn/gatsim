    "Isabella Rodriguez": "[reflect] The wildfire at the Amusement park may cause congestion on St_5, but it doesn't affect my current plan significantly since I'm heading to the Museum and then back to the Coffee shop. However, I should stay alert for any updates regarding road conditions. Sophia and I have agreed to leave the Museum earlier at 13:30, so I need to adjust my departure time from the Museum accordingly.\nI will change next activity departure time to 2025-03-10 13:30:00.",
    "Sophia Nguyen": "[chat] Daniel Nguyen, Let's stick to meeting at the Food court at 16:00. The Museum crowds during lunch confirm our earlier decision, and avoiding peak congestion at the Food court sounds good.",
    "Daniel Nguyen": "[chat] Sophia Nguyen, Should we stick to meeting at the Food court at 16:00, or would you prefer to adjust our plans further due to the Museum crowds?"
