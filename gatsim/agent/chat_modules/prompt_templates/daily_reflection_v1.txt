!<Args: 1>!

You play the role of the person:
!<Args: 2>!

Current time is !<Args: 3>!. Now you need to reflect on your daily experiences. Insights and important events should be recorded to help you to making better activity plans in the future.
You can also generate concepts (especially traffic related concepts) about important things or ideas to be remembered in the long term memory (optional but recommended). 



The output should be a dict in Json format with the following keys:
 - "reflection": Insights from today's activity plan revisions.
 - "concepts": a list of concepts; Here "concept" means an idea or thought to be remembered. These memories will help you to make better future decisions. 
 A concept should be a list of four elements:
[<content>, <keywords>, <spatial_scope>, <time_scope>]
where 
<content> is a string, which is the content of the concept;
<keywords> is a string composed of keywords separated by comma, like "Gym, crowded, 6PM";
<spatial_scope>:  a string that describe the spatial scope related to the concept. It must be a list of entities separated by comma. An entity can be a link name or road name or facility name or maze name.
If the concept content is about a link, say "Ave_3_link_2 is very congested in the morning", then spatial_scope is "Ave_3_link_2";
If the concept content is about a facility, say "Food court is crowded during 5PM - 6PM", then spatial_scope is "Food court";
If the concept content is about a road or a metro line, say "The Metro_2 is very crowded during 7AM - 9AM", then spatial_scope is "Metro_2";
If the concept is about a path, say "The path from Uptown apartment to Office (St_2_link_1 -> St_2_link_2 -> Ave_3_link_1 -> Ave_3_link_2 -> Ave_3_link_3) has long delay in the morning", then the spatial_scope should be "Uptown apartment, Office, St_2, Ave_3";
If the <content> is about the whole network, then the <spatial_scope> is "The town".
<time_scope>: time scope of the concept, it must be two time string separated by '-', like "11:00-13:30", and the time should be in 24-hour format. Do NOT include anything else in the time string (e.g. "11:00PM-1:30PM", '2025-03-10 12:00-16:00' are not allowed)!

Notes:
1) Person names, facility names, link names, road names, etc. should all be valid names (case sensitive).
2) Return just the json file content. DO NOT include any other information.

Example output:
{
    "reflection":"Today there is a car crash at Ave_3_link_2 on my way to Office to work in the morning. I got late due to the accident. Maybe I should go to work earlier next time. The school is really crowded in the afternoon peak hour. I should try to avoid School area in the afternoon peak hour.",
    "concepts": [
        ["Supermarket and Food court area around 6PM is very congested", "Supermarket, Food court, congested", "Supermarket, Food court", "18:00-19:00"],
        ["Ave_3_link_2 has long waiting time in morning peak hour", "Ave_3_link_2, long waiting time, morning peak hour", "Ave_3_link_2", "07:00-08:00"],
        ["School is crowded in the afternoon", "School, crowded, afternoon", "School", "17:30-18:30"]
