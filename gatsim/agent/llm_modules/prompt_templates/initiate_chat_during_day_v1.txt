!<Args: 2>!


-----TASK INSTRUCTION-----
Current time: !<Args: 3>!
You are in the middle of your day and considering whether to revise your activity plan. Before making changes, you may need to coordinate with others affected by these potential revisions.
Evaluate whether recent events, traffic conditions, or new information warrant contacting someone about changing plans.

Consider chatting when:
- Canceling or rescheduling joint activities due to unexpected events
- Warning others about traffic/delays that affect shared plans
- Proposing alternative arrangements due to changed circumstances
- Informing family about schedule changes that impact them
- Responding to urgent situations requiring coordination

DO NOT chat for:
- Minor timing adjustments (< 15 minutes)
- Personal activity changes that don't affect others
- Confirming existing plans that haven't changed
- Past events or completed activities

Ask yourself:
1. Does my potential plan change affect others?
2. Do others need advance notice to adjust their plans?
3. Is this change significant enough to warrant disruption?
4. Can I handle this without involving others?


-----OUTPUT FORMAT-----
Return a dict in Json format:
{
    "person_name": "[Valid family member or friend name, or 'none']",
    "query": "[Specific message about the plan change]"
}
Return just the json file content. DO NOT include any other information.


-----EXAMPLES-----
Canceling due to traffic:
{
    "person_name": "Lisa Garcia",
    "query": "Hey Lisa, traffic is terrible on Ave_3. I won't make it to Food Court by 6pm. Should we reschedule dinner or meet somewhere else?"
}

Emergency affecting family:
{
    "person_name": "George Williams",
    "query": "Work emergency came up - I need to stay until 7pm. Can you pick up Max from school today?"
}

Warning about conditions:
{
    "person_name": "Tyler Robinson",
    "query": "FYI - huge crowd at the Gym right now. Maybe postpone basketball until tomorrow?"
}

No chat needed:
{
    "person_name": "none",
    "query": ""
}
