!<Args: 1>!


You play the role of the person:
!<Args: 2>!


-----TASK INSTRUCTION-----
You are evaluating the importance of a !<Args: 3>! from the perspective of the person described above. 
Importance reflects how significantly this !<Args: 3>! will impact the person's:
- Immediate travel plans and route choices
- Daily commute patterns and schedules
- Safety and travel time efficiency
- Long-term transportation habits and preferences
- Social commitments that require travel


-----SCORING CRITERIA-----
Rate on a scale of 1-10 where:

**1-2: Routine, no impact on travel plans**
- Daily habits and regular observations
- Expected traffic conditions
- Information about rarely-used routes or times

One-time examples:
- [event] "Completed morning routine, taking Jason Chen to school as usual"
- [event] "Normal traffic flow observed on Highway 101 this morning"
- [chat] "Colleague mentioned the Coffee shop has great pastries"
Recurring pattern examples:
- [thought] "Traffic on St_5 is always light after 8 PM"
- [thought] "The 6 AM metro is usually empty and on time"

**3-4: Minor impact, might consider alternatives**
- Small inconveniences or slight delays (5-10 minutes)
- Weather beginning to affect traffic
- Useful information about secondary routes

One-time examples:
- [event] "Light rain starting, traffic becoming heavier on main roads"
- [event] "Small accident on 3rd Avenue causing 10-minute delay"
- [chat] "Coworker mentioned finding street parking was difficult today"
Recurring pattern examples:
- [thought] "Metro Line 1 occasionally has 6-minute delays during rush hour"
- [thought] "Oak Street tends to get busy on Friday afternoons"

**5-6: Moderate impact, likely to change plans**
- Significant delays (10-20 minutes) on regular routes
- Events affecting travel in the next few days
- Transportation service changes affecting routine

One-time examples:
- [event] "Construction starting on Main Street next week for 5 days"
- [chat] "Friend invited me to museum exhibition tomorrow at 10 AM downtown"
- [event] "The metro is running on reduced frequency today due to maintenance"
Recurring pattern examples:
- [thought] "Ave_2_link_2 regularly has 15 minute delays during morning peak"
- [thought] "Parking near office is becoming scarce after 8:30 AM most days"

**7-8: Major impact, must revise travel plans**
- Severe delays (20+ minutes) or route closures
- Recurring patterns significantly affecting daily commute
- Safety concerns requiring permanent route changes

One-time examples:
- [event] "Ave_2_link_2 on usual route to work closed for emergency repairs today"
- [event] "Major accident blocking highway, all traffic diverted to city streets"
- [chat] "My manager just called an emergency team meeting in 30 minutes"
Recurring pattern examples:
- [thought] "School zone traffic at 3 PM makes that area impassable - must find alternative"
- [thought] "Morning rush hour on Ave_2_link_2 consistently adds 30 minutes - need new route"
- [thought] "Downtown parking has become too expensive and scarce - should switch to transit"

**9-10: Critical impact, profound effects on daily life**
- System-wide transportation failures
- Emergency situations requiring immediate action
- Long-term changes forcing lifestyle adjustments

One-time examples:
- [event] "All roads closed due to flooding, shelter-in-place order issued"
- [event] "Wildfire near Amusement Park, mandatory evacuation of surrounding areas"
- [event] "Spouse texted that they're feeling very sick and need to go to hospital"
Recurring pattern examples:
- [thought] "Monday morning traffic has become completely gridlocked - may need to change work schedule"
- [thought] "Transportation network regularly fails during peak hours - city is becoming unlivable"


---IMPORTANT NOTES---
- Recurring patterns generally score 1-2 points higher than similar one-time events
- Long-term impacts (weeks/months) score higher than short-term (hours/days)
- Issues on your regular routes score higher
- Problems near your frequent destinations (home, work, school) score higher
