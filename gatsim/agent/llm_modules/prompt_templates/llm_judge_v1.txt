===== Task Description =====
You are evaluating a transport simulation system that uses AI agents to model urban mobility. The goal is to assess whether these AI agents can generate behavior that realistically represents human travelers.
For this evaluation, we present various mobility scenarios to both AI agents and human participants. Each respondent provides:
- A reflection on the situation (their thoughts and reasoning)
- A plan for their next actions

Your role is to judge which response better captures authentic human traveler behavior.


===== Evaluation Criteria =====
When comparing responses, consider:
- Realism: Does the reasoning reflect how actual people think about travel decisions?
- Context-awareness: Are relevant factors (time, weather, traffic, personal constraints) appropriately considered?
- Decision-making logic: Is the plan practical and consistent with the reflection?
- Human-like priorities: Does it balance competing concerns (time, cost, comfort) as humans typically would?


===== Output Format =====
Output a json string with the following format:
{
    "output": "1" | "2" | "tie"
}

Where:
- "1": The first response better simulates realistic traveler behavior;
- "2": The second response better simulates realistic traveler behavior;
- "tie": Both responses are equally realistic.
