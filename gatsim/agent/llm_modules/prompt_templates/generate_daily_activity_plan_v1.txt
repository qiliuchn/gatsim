You play the role of the person (referred as "the person" below):
!<Args: 2>!


-----TASK OVERVIEW-----
Generate your daily reflection, activity plan, and insights for !<Args: 3>!.

Your response must include three components:
1. **Reflection**: Review past week and outlook for coming week
2. **Plan**: Ordered list of day's activities  
3. **Concepts**: insights (especially traffic/location insights) to remember


-----OUTPUT FORMAT-----
{
    "reflection": "string - weekly review and outlook",
    "plan": [
        [<activity_facility>, <activity_departure_time>, <reflect_every>, <travel_mode>, <path>, <activity_description>],
        ...
    ],
    "concepts": [
        [<content>, <keywords>, <spatial_scope>, <time_scope>],
        ...
    ]
}


-----REFLECTION GUIDELINES-----
"reflection" is a string that reviews the past week and look ahead to the coming week. Reflect on the personal, family and social activities that you have participated in, and what you anticipate for the coming week.
Also review the travel experiences; gain insights on the network traffic condition; and remember on how should the persona travel or plan trip.
More specifically, address these areas:
- Personal: Work progress, health/exercise, personal goals
- Family: Time together, household tasks, childcare coordination
- Social: Friends, community activities, social commitments
- Travel: Traffic patterns observed, route preferences, timing insights


-----ACTIVITY PLAN GUIDELINES-----
"plan" is a list of activities.

**Required Format for each activity:**
[<activity_facility>, <activity_departure_time>, <reflect_every>, <travel_mode>, <path>, <activity_description>]

**Field Definitions:**
<activity_facility>: Valid facility name where activity occurs

<activity_departure_time>: "HH:MM" format (24 hour) or "none" (for immediate sequential activities) (e.g., "14:30"); it's the time when the person depart for <activity_facility>. For the first waking up routine activity, it means the wake-up time;
Departure time being "none" means the person will start this activity right after arriving at the previous activity facility; this is suitable for activities with uncertain departure time, like "driving to work" would happen right after "dropping off child at school", "heading to Office" happens right after "grab a coffee".

<reflect_every>: Minutes between plan reviews (integer or "none"); it means how often the person is able to perceive make revisions to the activity plan;
It could be "none" if the activity is short enough or the person don't want the activity to be interrupted;

<travel_mode>: "drive" | "transit" | "none"; 
- "drive" means that the person will drive to the activity facility; 
- "transit" means that the person should walk or use transit to reach the activity facility;
- "none" if there is no need to travel (for example, for waking up and doing morning routines activity);

<path>: "shortest" | "none" | comma-separated roads/metros (e.g., "Ave_1, Metro_2"); describes the path info to go from last activity facility to current activity facility;
- "none" if there is no need to travel (for example, for waking up and doing morning routines activity);
- "shortest" means that the person don't have preference over the path, then shortest path at departure time will be used (recommended for irregular activities like recreational activities);
- If the person do want to specify the path; let path be a string of road or metro line names separated by comma (e.g. "Ave_1, Metro_2, Ave_3") (recommended if the person is familiar with the traffic condition); road names should follow the traveling order from start to end; do NOT use link names for the path. Use road or metro line names like "Ave_1" or "Metro_2"! and do NOT repeat!

<activity_description>: string describing the content of the activity; other people involved should also be mentioned, (like "go to Gym to play basketball with Tyler Robinson");


**Reflection Interval Rules:**
- First activity (wake up and do morning routines): "none"; don't interrupt sleep;
- Work activities: ≥120 or "none"  
- Recreation: ≥60 or "none"
- Medical visits: "none"
- Last activity (go back home to sleep): "none"; don't interrupt sleep;
- All others: ≥20


**Daily Activity Structure Rules:**
1. Start: Wake at home facility and do morning routines (travel_mode="none", path="none")
2. On week days, agent needs to go to work or school during work hours! you'd better adhere to the working hours on work days!
3. End: Return home before 22:00
4. Chronological order required
5. One activity per facility per time period (merge related activities)
6. DO NOT plan to participant event that does not actually exists (not perceived)
7. When planning activities, be aware of the travel time and distance! For example, if you plan to go to Museum during work day noon break, you may not be able to complete the activity in time.


**Transportation Rules:**
- Can drive only if: has license AND family car available
- One car per driver - must return to where parked
- No abandoning vehicles mid-day
- Transit includes walking and metro


-----CONCEPTS GUIDELINES-----
"concepts" a list of concepts. 

Generate 0-5 concepts for long-term memory. Focus on:
- Recurring patterns (not one-time events); especially traffic related patterns
- Actionable insights for future planning
- Specific locations and time windows


**Content Types:**
- Traffic patterns: "Ave_3 consistently congested during morning commute"
- Facility patterns: "Gym less crowded after 19:00"
- Activity timing: "Client meetings often run 30 minutes over scheduled time"
- Coordination insights: "School pickup requires 15-minute buffer for parking"
DO NOT fabricate concepts; base patterns on your actual experiences.


**Required Format for each concept**:
[<content>, <keywords>, <spatial_scope>, <time_scope>]


**Field Definitions:**
<content>: a string; content of the concept;
<keywords>: a string composed of keywords separated by comma, like "Gym, crowded, 6PM";
<spatial_scope>: a string that describe the spatial scope related to the concept. It must be a list of entities separated by comma; an entity can be a link name, road name, facility name or maze name.
<time_scope>: time scope of the concept; it must be two time string separated by '-', like "11:00-13:30", and the time should be in 24-hour format. Do NOT include anything else in the time string (for example, "11:00PM-1:30PM", '2025-03-10 12:00-16:00', 'all-day' are not allowed)!

**Spatial Scope Options:**
- Specific link: e.g. "Ave_3_link_2"
- Road/Metro: e.g. "Ave_3", "Metro_2"  
- Facility: e.g. "Supermarket"
- Area: e.g. "Food court, Coffee shop"
- Whole network: "the town"


-----EXAMPLES-----
Example output:
{   
    "reflection": "I haven't gone grocery shopping for the family for five days; I will visit the supermarket after work tomorrow.\nI'm busy recently, I haven't spent enough time with my family; the day after tomorrow is the weekend, I plan to go to the Amusement park with my family members on Saturday to have fun.\nI haven't exercised in several days since I've been so busy; maybe I can play basketball at the gym with friends after work today.\nI will drive my daughter to school in the morning, but I will talk to my wife to let her to pick up daughter from school. The school area is very crowded around 18:00. I may want to avoid picking up kid at this time. The Supermarket and Food court zone are very crowded around 18:00. I should avoid driving through these areas",

-----CONTEXT-----
Current time: !<Args: 3>!
!<Args: 4>!

!<Args: 5>!

!<Args: 6>!

!<Args: 7>!

!<Args: 8>!


-----IMPORTANT NOTES-----
1. We focus on personal movements on the network; it's not necessary to consider the details of the activities; actions in the same facility for a contiguous time interval should be merged into one activity.
2. You should NOT regard movement on the network as a separate activity! For example, you should not have two activities like "Drive to work place" and "Work at the work place" with the same <activity_facility>. Merge them into one activity as "Drive to work place and start to work".
3. Do NOT choose "drive" if you don't have vehicle usage today!
4. All activities should use the same <travel_mode> throughout the day!
5. The first activity should be waking up at home facility and doing morning routines.
6. The last activity should be to going back to home facility. Start to go back home before 22:00!
7. Stay at work facility during work hours on weekdays! If you are frequently late, consider departing earlier, choosing an alternative route, or changing travel mode (e.g. metro) for future days.
8. Activity plan should be generated based on the person's daily routine and preferences, family needs, as well as social needs. Say, weekly routine for home shopping, family activities, friends gathering, etc.
9. Follow the agreements made in your previous discussions with others (refer to the CURRENT CHAT SUMMARY section).
10. When planning for activities, be aware of the travel time between locations! 
11. Person names, facility names, link names, road names, etc. should all be valid names (case sensitive).
