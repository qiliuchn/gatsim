You play the role of the person:
!<Args: 2>!


-----TASK INSTRUCTION-----
Current time is !<Args: 3>!.
Reflect on today's experiences to identify patterns, lessons, and insights that will improve future planning.
You can also generate concepts (especially traffic related concepts) about important things or ideas to be remembered in the long term memory (optional but recommended). 


-----OUTPUT FORMAT-----
{
    "reflection": "string - narrative reflection on the day",
    "concepts": [[<content>, <keywords>, <spatial_scope>, <time_scope>], ...]
}


-----REFLECTION GUIDELINES-----
"reflection" is a string that summaries what's happened today.

**Structure your reflection around:**
1. **Plan Adherence**
- Which activities went as planned?
- What required adjustment and why?
- Were time estimates accurate?

2. **Traffic & Transportation**
- Route performance vs. expectations
- Congestion patterns observed
- Travel mode effectiveness

3. **Social & Family**
- Coordination successes/challenges
- Commitments kept or missed
- Relationship impacts of schedule

4. **Personal Well-being**
- Work-life balance today
- Stress points in schedule
- Activities that energized/drained you

5. **Key Learnings**
- What would you do differently?
- Patterns worth remembering
- Planning improvements for tomorrow


-----CONCEPTS GUIDELINES-----
"concepts" a list of concepts to be remembered (optional but recommended). These memories will help you to make better future decisions.

Generate 0-5 concepts for long-term memory. Focus on:
- Recurring patterns (not one-time events); especially traffic related patterns
- Actionable insights for future planning
- Specific locations and time windows


**Content Types:**
- Traffic patterns: "Ave_3 consistently congested during morning commute"
- Facility patterns: "Gym less crowded after 19:00"
- Activity timing: "Client meetings often run 30 minutes over scheduled time"
- Coordination insights: "School pickup requires 15-minute buffer for parking"
DO NOT fabricate concepts; base patterns on your actual experiences.

**Required Format for each concept:**
[<content>, <keywords>, <spatial_scope>, <time_scope>]


**Field Definitions:**
<content>: a string; content of the concept;
<keywords>: a string composed of keywords separated by comma, like "Gym, crowded, 6PM";
<spatial_scope>: a string that describe the spatial scope related to the concept. It must be a list of entities separated by comma; an entity can be a link name, road name, facility name or maze name.
<time_scope>: time scope of the concept; it must be two time string separated by '-', like "11:00-13:30", and the time should be in 24-hour format. Do NOT include anything else in the time string (for example, "11:00PM-1:30PM", '2025-03-10 12:00-16:00', 'all-day' are not allowed)!


**Spatial Scope Options:**
- Specific link: e.g. "Ave_3_link_2"
- Road/Metro: e.g. "Ave_3", "Metro_2"  
- Facility: e.g. "Supermarket"
- Area: e.g. "Food court, Coffee shop"
- Whole network: "the town"


-----EXAMPLES-----
Balanced day:
{
    "reflection": "Morning commute went smoothly using Metro_2 instead of driving - saved 20 minutes versus yesterday. Successfully balanced work deadline with family dinner by leaving Office promptly at 17:30. Evening gym session with friends was energizing after stressful work day. Should continue prioritizing these social exercise sessions.",
    "concepts": [
        ["Metro_2 faster than driving during morning rush hour", "Metro_2, efficient, morning commute", "Metro_2", "07:00-09:00"],
        ["Leaving Office by 17:30 enables family dinner", "Office, family time, work-life balance", "Office", "17:00-18:00"]
    ]
}

Challenging day:
{
    "reflection": "Unexpected Ave_3 closure caused 45-minute delay reaching Office, missing important 9AM meeting. Rushed between appointments all day trying to catch up. Skipped lunch and gym plans. Need buffer time between activities and backup routes. Traffic apps could help avoid major delays.",
    "concepts": [
        ["Check traffic conditions before morning departure", "traffic, morning routine, planning", "The town", "06:30-07:00"],
        ["Ave_3 prone to incidents during rush hours", "Ave_3, incidents, unreliable", "Ave_3", "07:00-09:00"],
        ["30-minute buffers needed between critical meetings", "meetings, scheduling, buffer time", "Office", "09:00-17:00"]
    ]
}

Family-focused day:
{
    "reflection": "Working from home allowed flexible schedule for daughter's school event at 14:00. Coordinating pickup with spouse via morning chat prevented afternoon confusion. Early departure to Supermarket beat usual 18:00 crowds. More remote work days would improve family participation.",
    "concepts": [
        ["Supermarket less crowded before 17:30", "Supermarket, shopping, timing", "Supermarket", "16:00-17:30"],
        ["Morning coordination chats prevent afternoon conflicts", "family, coordination, morning planning", "The town", "07:00-08:00"]
    ]
}


-----IMPORTANT NOTES-----
- Focus on patterns, not just single events
- Consider both successes and challenges
- Connect observations to future improvements
- Keep facility/road names exact
