Description: This defines the "Perceive" module for generative agents. 

This function gathers nearby events from the environment and then checks against the most recent events already stored in long term memory 
and update the perceived event to long term memory if it's new. 


# Transportation information used for decision making - four types of info:
 - nearby events, like car crash congestion (NetworkEvent); they are NetworkEvent then converted to ConceptNode;
 - broadcast news (like flooding, wildfire) (NetworkEVent); they are NetworkEvent then converted to ConceptNode;
 - network traffic state description (str); network level; only congestion information; acts like traffic congestion map;
 - transport experiences (ConceptNode); they are created after waiting on a link a or after a trip, then inserted to lt_mem;


# Events to be perceived:
 - 1) current effective nearby network events (list[NetworkEvent])
 - 2) current effective maze broadcast news (list[NetworkEvent obj])
 - 3) current family member events (list[ConceptNode])
 - 4) current friends events (list[ConceptNode])
 - 5) current within-same-facility personas events (list[ConceptNode])
 - 6) network traffic state (str)
