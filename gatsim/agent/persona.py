# The main cognition sequence:
    perceive -> retrieve -> reflect & plan -> execute
 
 -	Perceive the environment: get the events that are happening around the persona, and what activity his or her family members and friends are engaged in.
 -	Retrieve relevant memories: use the retrieve function to get relevant memories from self.lt_mem.
 - Reflect on experiences: reflect on past experiences, perceived events, retrieved memories.
 - Plan the activities: based on the reflection, determined whether the plan need to be updated; if so, update the activity plan for the rest of the day.
 -	Execute the plan.
