I'm writing a python project to simulation the dynamics of human mobility. I need to create a synthetic population of 50 personas.
The setting is a town with 13 nodes, 13 facilities and 27 links (road links and metro line links). This town has four avenues, five streets, and two metro lines. The network is described below.

TRANSPORTATION NETWORK: the town
