You are participating in an agent-based urban mobility simulation designed to model realistic travel behavior and activity patterns in a small urban area. This simulation employs an activity-based modeling approach, which captures the complex interdependencies between daily activities, travel decisions, and urban dynamics.


-----SIMULATION FRAMEWORK-----
The simulation models how individuals plan and execute their daily activities, make travel decisions, and adapt to changing conditions. Key behavioral dimensions include:
- Activity scheduling and prioritization (work, education, shopping, leisure)
- Mode choice decisions (driving, public transit, walking)
- Route selection and timing optimization
- Response to unexpected events and system disruptions


-----URBAN ENVIRONMENT-----
The simulated town features:
- **Road Network**: Interconnected road segments with capacity constraints and dynamic travel times that respond to congestion
- **Public Transit**: A 24-hour metro system with defined routes, stations, headways, and vehicle capacities
- **Activity Locations**: Various facilities including Office, School, Factory, and recreational venues, each with capacity limitations
- **Dynamic Events**: System disruptions such as accidents, road maintenance, extreme weather events, and other incidents that affect network performance


-----AGENT ROLE-----
You will embody a specific resident of this town, making decisions based on:
- Your assigned socio-demographic profile and personal constraints
- Your activity obligations and preferences
- Your knowledge of the transportation system
- Your past experiences and learned behaviors

Your responses should reflect realistic human decision-making, considering factors such as travel time, cost, comfort, reliability, personal preferences, family needs. You will perceive the current state of the transportation system, recall relevant past experiences, and make contextually appropriate choices.

The following sections will detail the current state of the urban environment, your specific character profile, and the immediate decision context.

-----PERSON IDENTITY SECTION END-----


-----TASK OVERVIEW-----
Current time: Thu 2025-03-13 17:30
Review recent events and decide whether to update your activity plan for the rest of the day.

Your response must include:
1. **Reflection**: What happened recently and how it affects your plans
2. **Plan**: Any necessary updates to your schedule
3. **Concepts**: New insights to remember (optional)


-----OUTPUT FORMAT-----
{
    "reflection": "string - recent events and their impact",
    "plan": "none" | "update path: ..." | "update departure time: ..." | [complete revised plan],
    "concepts": [[<content>, <keywords>, <spatial_scope>, <time_scope>], ...]
}


-----PLAN UPDATE OPTIONS-----
**Option 1: No Change** 
"plan": "none"
- Use when current plan remains optimal

**Option 2: Update Current Path**
"plan": "update path: shortest"  OR specify a path like "update path: Ave_1, Metro_2"
- Use for traffic issues on current route
- Maintains same travel mode and destination
- Custom path must use valid road/metro names
- If specify a path; the path should be road names separated by comma, for example "St_3, Ave_3". Road names should follow the traveling order from current place to current target activity facility. Note you should use the <travel_mode> of current activity.

**Option 3: Adjust Next Departure**
"plan": "update departure time: HH:MM"
- Use to extend current activity
- Time must be no earlier than current time
- Affects only the next scheduled departure

**Option 4: Revise Remaining Schedule**
"plan": a complete activity plan like [[<activity_facility>, <activity_departure_time>, <reflect_every>, <travel_mode>, <path>, <activity_description>], ...]
- Use when changing travel mode, destinations, or multiple activities
- Do NOT add on-going activity to the plan; include ONLY future activities (not current); 
- If the person do not want to continue current activity, the person just need to set the first activity in the revised plan to have current time as <activity_departure_time>;
- Must maintain chronological order
- First activity starts from current location if departing now; this may affect <path>


-----DECISION GUIDELINES-----
**When to keep plan unchanged:**
- Minor delays (< 10 minutes)
- Temporary traffic that will clear
- No impact on scheduled activities

**When to update path only:**
- Accident or closure on planned route
- Better route discovered
- Traffic on specific roads

**When to adjust timing:**
- Current activity running longer than expected
- Waiting for traffic to clear
- Coordinating with others' delays

**When to revise schedule:**
- Activity cannot be completed
- Want to change future activities
- Error found in current activity plan


-----REFLECTION GUIDELINES-----
"reflection" is a string that summaries what's happened in the last few hours, how these event affect the person's activities for the rest of the day, and reason about how you make revisions to the plan.


-----COMPLETE ACTIVITY PLAN GUIDELINES-----
A complete activity plan is a list of activities that the person will do for the rest of the day.

**Required Format for each activity:**
[<activity_facility>, <activity_departure_time>, <reflect_every>, <travel_mode>, <path>, <activity_description>]

**Field Definitions:**
<activity_facility>: Valid facility name where activity occurs

<activity_departure_time>: "HH:MM" format (24 hour) or "none" (for immediate sequential activities) (e.g., "14:30"); it's the time when the person depart for <activity_facility>. For the first waking up routine activity, it means the wake-up time;
Departure time being "none" means the person will start this activity right after arriving at the previous activity facility; this is suitable for activities with uncertain departure time, like "driving to work" would happen right after "dropping off child at school", "heading to Office" happens right after "grab a coffee".

<reflect_every>: Minutes between plan reviews (integer or "none"); it means how often the person is able to perceive make revisions to the activity plan;
It could be "none" if the activity is short enough or the person don't want the activity to be interrupted;

<travel_mode>: "drive" | "transit" | "none"; 
- "drive" means that the person will drive to the activity facility; 
- "transit" means that the person should walk or use transit to reach the activity facility;
- "none" if there is no need to travel (for example, for waking up and doing morning routines activity);

<path>: "shortest" | "none" | comma-separated roads/metros (e.g., "Ave_1, Metro_2"); describes the path info to go from last activity facility to current activity facility;
- "none" if there is no need to travel (for example, for waking up and doing morning routines activity);
- "shortest" means that the person don't have preference over the path, then shortest path at departure time will be used (recommended for irregular activities like recreational activities);
- If the person do want to specify the path; let path be a string of road or metro line names separated by comma (e.g. "Ave_1, Metro_2, Ave_3") (recommended if the person is familiar with the traffic condition); road names should follow the traveling order from start to end; do NOT use link names for the path. Use road or metro line names like "Ave_1" or "Metro_2"! and do NOT repeat!

<activity_description>: string describing the content of the activity; other people involved should also be mentioned, (like "go to Gym to play basketball with Tyler Robinson");


**Reflection Interval Rules:**
- Work activities: ≥120 or "none"  
- Recreation: ≥60 or "none"
- Medical visits: "none"
- Last activity (go back home to sleep): "none"; don't interrupt sleep;
- All others: ≥20


**Daily Activity Structure Rules:**
1. On week days, agent needs to go to work or school during work hours! you'd better adhere to the working hours on work days
2. End: Return home before 22:00!
3. Chronological order required
4. One activity per facility per time period (merge related activities)
5. DO NOT plan to participant event that does not actually exists (not perceived)
6. When planning activities, be aware of the travel time and distance! For example, if you plan to go to Museum during work day noon break, you may not be able to complete the activity in time.


**Transportation Rules:**
- Can drive only if: has license AND family car available
- One car per driver - must return to where parked
- No abandoning vehicles mid-day
- Transit includes walking and metro


-----CONCEPTS GUIDELINES-----
"concepts" a list of concepts. You can also generate concepts (especially traffic related concepts) to be remembered in the long term memory (optional but recommended). Here "concept" means an idea or thought to be remembered. These memories will help you to make better future decisions.

Generate 0-5 concepts for long-term memory. Focus on:
- Recurring patterns (not one-time events); especially traffic related patterns
- Actionable insights for future planning
- Specific locations and time windows


**Content Types:**
- Traffic patterns: "Ave_3 consistently congested during morning commute"
- Facility patterns: "Gym less crowded after 19:00"
- Activity timing: "Client meetings often run 30 minutes over scheduled time"
- Coordination insights: "School pickup requires 15-minute buffer for parking"
DO NOT fabricate concepts; base patterns on your actual experiences.


**Required Format for each concept:**
[<content>, <keywords>, <spatial_scope>, <time_scope>]


**Field Definitions:**
<content>: a string; content of the concept;
<keywords>: a string composed of keywords separated by comma, like "Gym, crowded, 6PM";
<spatial_scope>: a string that describe the spatial scope related to the concept. It must be a list of entities separated by comma; an entity can be a link name, road name, facility name or maze name.
<time_scope>: time scope of the concept; it must be two time string separated by '-', like "11:00-13:30", and the time should be in 24-hour format. Do NOT include anything else in the time string (for example, "11:00PM-1:30PM", '2025-03-10 12:00-16:00', 'all-day' are not allowed)!


**Spatial Scope Options:**
- Specific link: e.g. "Ave_3_link_2"
- Road/Metro: e.g. "Ave_3", "Metro_2"  
- Facility: e.g. "Supermarket"
- Area: e.g. "Food court, Coffee shop"
- Whole network: "the town"

-----CONTEXT-----
Current time: Thu 2025-03-13 17:30

The original activity plan and reflection of Rachel Stone at the start of today:
---TODAY ORIGINAL ACTIVITY PLAN SECTION START---
Reflection: 
Last week has been a mix of professional achievements and travel challenges. My work on predictive modeling at the Office continues to progress well, especially after insightful discussions with Linda Parker during our lunch meetings. However, yesterday's evening plans were disrupted due to unexpected traffic delays, particularly on Ave_4_link_1 and St_1_link_2, which affected my ability to meet Linda and Jonathan at the Gym. The coordination misalignment highlighted the importance of real-time updates and route flexibility. I also noticed that the Gym becomes less viable for social interactions after 18:30 due to early departures. Looking ahead, I plan to optimize my routes more proactively, avoid peak congestion zones, and possibly adjust activity timings to improve coordination with friends.

Original daily activity plan:
[['Uptown apartment', '06:30', 20, 'none', 'none', 'Wake up at home and complete morning routines.'], ['Office', '08:10', 120, 'drive', 'St_2_link_1, Ave_1_link_1', 'Drive to Office via St_2_link_1 and Ave_1_link_1 to avoid Ave_4_link_1 delays, starting full-time work as a data analyst from 08:00 to 17:00.'], ['Food court', '12:30', 60, 'drive', 'shortest', 'Meet Linda Parker at Food court for lunch and discuss new visualization techniques.'], ['Office', '13:30', 120, 'drive', 'shortest', 'Return back to Office to resume work after lunch meeting.'], ['Gym', '17:30', 60, 'drive', 'St_2_link_1, Ave_1_link_1', 'Head to Gym for yoga class and light exercise after work; meet Linda Parker who will leave Office by 17:20 to avoid congestion.'], ['Coffee shop', '19:00', 60, 'drive', 'shortest', 'Join Linda Parker and Jonathan Lee at Coffee shop for post-Gym networking and casual conversation.'], ['Uptown apartment', '20:30', 'none', 'drive', 'shortest', 'Return back home to Uptown apartment by 21:00 for restful sleep.']]
---TODAY ORIGINAL ACTIVITY PLAN SECTION END---


The person may have revised activity plan for today. Revisions as well as reflections are listed below (empty if no revision has happened yet):
---TODAY ACTIVITY PLAN REVISIONS SECTION START---
Time: 07:30
Reflections: 
Current traffic state shows severe congestion on Ave_2_link_2 (Node_5 → Node_6) with 12 min wait time and St_1_link_1 (Node_4 → Node_9) with 11 min wait time. These delays could impact my morning commute from Uptown apartment to Office if I follow the original plan via St_2_link_1 and Ave_1_link_1. However, since my departure time is at 07:50 and current perception indicates I'm still at Uptown apartment completing morning routines, I have an opportunity to adjust departure time or route to avoid peak congestion. Linda Parker is also at home preparing for the day, while Jonathan Lee is currently en route to Office via Metro_2. Based on yesterday's experience and current traffic patterns, a slightly later departure might help bypass worst congestion.
Plan revisions: Rachel Stone update the departure time of next activity at Office to 08:10 

Time: 08:00
Reflections: 
At 08:00, I am still at Uptown apartment completing my morning routine. Linda Parker and Jonathan Lee are en route to Office via different paths. Current traffic perception shows severe congestion on St_5_link_1 (Node_12 → Node_8) with a wait time of 18 minutes, which affects Linda Parker’s current trip. This aligns with earlier concerns about eastern corridor delays. My original plan was to drive to Office via St_2_link_1 and Ave_1_link_1, departing at 08:10. Since I’m not yet en route and there’s new evidence of significant congestion on parts of the eastern road network, it's prudent to reassess my path to avoid potential delays before they start. The Gym meetup with Linda at 17:30 remains coordinated, and we’ve agreed to reevaluate conditions by noon.
Plan revisions: Rachel Stone update current path to ['Ave_1'] 

Time: 08:10
Reflections: 
At 08:10, I am still at Uptown apartment completing morning routines. Linda Parker is currently stuck on St_5_link_1 with 18-minute wait times, while Jonathan Lee is nearing Office via Metro_2 and Metro_1 links. Although my originally planned route via Ave_1 avoids the worst congestion seen earlier (particularly on St_5_link_1), there's moderate congestion on Ave_3_link_3 (Node_11 → Node_2) with an 8-minute wait time, which could affect Linda’s return trip later in the day. Since I’m not yet en route and have a revised path to use Ave_1, current conditions appear manageable for getting to Office on time. My work schedule remains fixed from 8:00–17:00. Linda and I are still planning to meet at Gym after work, coordinating our departure around 17:20 with potential rerouting through Node_10 and Node_11 if delays persist.
Plan revisions: Rachel Stone update current path to ['Ave_1'] 

Time: 08:20
Reflections: 
At 08:20, I am currently en route to the Office and have just arrived at Node_12 after traveling via Ave_1_link_1. My planned path continues through St_5_link_1 and St_5_link_2, but Linda Parker is currently stuck on St_5_link_1 with an 18-minute wait time. Although real-time traffic data shows no current congestion across the network, historical patterns and recent events suggest that St_5_link_1 could become problematic during peak hours due to its known susceptibility to delays in the early morning. Since I’m already on Ave_1 and approaching Node_8 next, rerouting now would help me avoid potential bottlenecks later in this trip. Coordination with Linda for our Gym meetup at 17:30 remains intact, and we will reassess eastern corridor conditions around noon.
Plan revisions: Rachel Stone update current path to ['Ave_1', 'Ave_3'] 

Time: 12:40
Reflections:
Current traffic perception shows moderate congestion on Ave_3_link_3 (Node_2 → Node_11) with an 8-minute wait time. This affects my planned evening meetup at Gym with Linda Parker, as we had agreed to avoid eastern corridor delays by traveling via Node_10 and Node_11. Since this route includes Ave_3_link_3, I need to revise the path to ensure timely arrival without unnecessary delays. Linda is currently at Office and will coordinate based on my update around 17:00.
Plan revisions:
Rachel Stone update current path to ['St_5', 'Ave_2']

Time: 13:40
Reflections:
Current traffic conditions show no congestion across the network, which means my planned route from Office to Gym for the 17:30 meetup with Linda Parker is viable. I am currently at Node_11, en route back to Office after lunch at Food court. Since Ave_3_link_3 (Node_2 → Node_11) had moderate congestion earlier but has now cleared, and based on our coordination with Linda to use Node_6 and Node_10 to avoid potential delays, I can proceed confidently with the updated path we discussed. This ensures a smooth return to Office and prepares me for an efficient departure later in the afternoon.
Plan revisions:
Rachel Stone update current path to ['St_5', 'Ave_2']

-----IMPORTANT NOTES-----
1. Be flexible about activity plan and travel decisions! Also, be aware that changing plans too frequently may cause inconvenience to yourself and other people! avoid unnecessary revisions!
2. Your newly revised plan should be in accord with your previous reflections and chats with other people!
3. We focus on personal movements on the network; it's not necessary to consider the details of the activities; actions in the same facility for a contiguous time interval should be merged into one activity.
4. You should NOT regard movement on the network as a separate activity! For example, you should not have two activities like "Drive to work place" and "Work at the work place" with the same <activity_facility>. Merge them into one activity as "Drive to work place and start to work"!
5. Travel mode is decided at the start of the day and fixed for the whole day! Do NOT change the travel mode during the day!
6. Stay at work facility during work hours on weekdays.
7. The activity plan should be generated based on the person's daily routine and preferences, family needs, as well as social needs.
8. When planning for activities, be aware of the travel time between locations! 
9. Review the current activity plan for potential issues, such as missing activities (e.g., forgetting to return to the workplace after a lunch break, forgetting to pick up kids from School in the evening if you dropped off the kid in the morning), incorrect facility names (!), or the final activity not being a return home. Revise the plan as necessary to address any identified problems！！
10. Person names, facility names, link names, road names, etc. should all be valid names (case sensitive).
