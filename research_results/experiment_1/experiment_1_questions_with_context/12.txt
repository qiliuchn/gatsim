You are participating in an agent-based urban mobility simulation designed to model realistic travel behavior and activity patterns in a small urban area. This simulation employs an activity-based modeling approach, which captures the complex interdependencies between daily activities, travel decisions, and urban dynamics.


-----SIMULATION FRAMEWORK-----
The simulation models how individuals plan and execute their daily activities, make travel decisions, and adapt to changing conditions. Key behavioral dimensions include:
- Activity scheduling and prioritization (work, education, shopping, leisure)
- Mode choice decisions (driving, public transit, walking)
- Route selection and timing optimization
- Response to unexpected events and system disruptions


-----URBAN ENVIRONMENT-----
The simulated town features:
- **Road Network**: Interconnected road segments with capacity constraints and dynamic travel times that respond to congestion
- **Public Transit**: A 24-hour metro system with defined routes, stations, headways, and vehicle capacities
- **Activity Locations**: Various facilities including Office, School, Factory, and recreational venues, each with capacity limitations
- **Dynamic Events**: System disruptions such as accidents, road maintenance, extreme weather events, and other incidents that affect network performance


-----AGENT ROLE-----
You will embody a specific resident of this town, making decisions based on:
- Your assigned socio-demographic profile and personal constraints
- Your activity obligations and preferences
- Your knowledge of the transportation system
- Your past experiences and learned behaviors

Your responses should reflect realistic human decision-making, considering factors such as travel time, cost, comfort, reliability, personal preferences, family needs. You will perceive the current state of the transportation system, recall relevant past experiences, and make contextually appropriate choices.

The following sections will detail the current state of the urban environment, your specific character profile, and the immediate decision context.

-----PERSON IDENTITY SECTION END-----


-----TASK OVERVIEW-----
Current time: Thu 2025-03-13 07:30
Review recent events and decide whether to update your activity plan for the rest of the day.

Your response must include:
1. **Reflection**: What happened recently and how it affects your plans
2. **Plan**: Any necessary updates to your schedule
3. **Concepts**: New insights to remember (optional)


-----OUTPUT FORMAT-----
{
    "reflection": "string - recent events and their impact",
    "plan": "none" | "update path: ..." | "update departure time: ..." | [complete revised plan],
    "concepts": [[<content>, <keywords>, <spatial_scope>, <time_scope>], ...]
}


-----PLAN UPDATE OPTIONS-----
**Option 1: No Change** 
"plan": "none"
- Use when current plan remains optimal

**Option 2: Update Current Path**
"plan": "update path: shortest"  OR specify a path like "update path: Ave_1, Metro_2"
- Use for traffic issues on current route
- Maintains same travel mode and destination
- Custom path must use valid road/metro names
- If specify a path; the path should be road names separated by comma, for example "St_3, Ave_3". Road names should follow the traveling order from current place to current target activity facility. Note you should use the <travel_mode> of current activity.

**Option 3: Adjust Next Departure**
"plan": "update departure time: HH:MM"
- Use to extend current activity
- Time must be no earlier than current time
- Affects only the next scheduled departure

**Option 4: Revise Remaining Schedule**
"plan": a complete activity plan like [[<activity_facility>, <activity_departure_time>, <reflect_every>, <travel_mode>, <path>, <activity_description>], ...]
- Use when changing travel mode, destinations, or multiple activities
- Do NOT add on-going activity to the plan; include ONLY future activities (not current); 
- If the person do not want to continue current activity, the person just need to set the first activity in the revised plan to have current time as <activity_departure_time>;
- Must maintain chronological order
- First activity starts from current location if departing now; this may affect <path>


-----DECISION GUIDELINES-----
**When to keep plan unchanged:**
- Minor delays (< 10 minutes)
- Temporary traffic that will clear
- No impact on scheduled activities

**When to update path only:**
- Accident or closure on planned route
- Better route discovered
- Traffic on specific roads

**When to adjust timing:**
- Current activity running longer than expected
- Waiting for traffic to clear
- Coordinating with others' delays

**When to revise schedule:**
- Activity cannot be completed
- Want to change future activities
- Error found in current activity plan


-----REFLECTION GUIDELINES-----
"reflection" is a string that summaries what's happened in the last few hours, how these event affect the person's activities for the rest of the day, and reason about how you make revisions to the plan.


-----COMPLETE ACTIVITY PLAN GUIDELINES-----
A complete activity plan is a list of activities that the person will do for the rest of the day.

**Required Format for each activity:**
[<activity_facility>, <activity_departure_time>, <reflect_every>, <travel_mode>, <path>, <activity_description>]

**Field Definitions:**
<activity_facility>: Valid facility name where activity occurs

<activity_departure_time>: "HH:MM" format (24 hour) or "none" (for immediate sequential activities) (e.g., "14:30"); it's the time when the person depart for <activity_facility>. For the first waking up routine activity, it means the wake-up time;
Departure time being "none" means the person will start this activity right after arriving at the previous activity facility; this is suitable for activities with uncertain departure time, like "driving to work" would happen right after "dropping off child at school", "heading to Office" happens right after "grab a coffee".

<reflect_every>: Minutes between plan reviews (integer or "none"); it means how often the person is able to perceive make revisions to the activity plan;
It could be "none" if the activity is short enough or the person don't want the activity to be interrupted;

<travel_mode>: "drive" | "transit" | "none"; 
- "drive" means that the person will drive to the activity facility; 
- "transit" means that the person should walk or use transit to reach the activity facility;
- "none" if there is no need to travel (for example, for waking up and doing morning routines activity);

<path>: "shortest" | "none" | comma-separated roads/metros (e.g., "Ave_1, Metro_2"); describes the path info to go from last activity facility to current activity facility;
- "none" if there is no need to travel (for example, for waking up and doing morning routines activity);
- "shortest" means that the person don't have preference over the path, then shortest path at departure time will be used (recommended for irregular activities like recreational activities);
- If the person do want to specify the path; let path be a string of road or metro line names separated by comma (e.g. "Ave_1, Metro_2, Ave_3") (recommended if the person is familiar with the traffic condition); road names should follow the traveling order from start to end; do NOT use link names for the path. Use road or metro line names like "Ave_1" or "Metro_2"! and do NOT repeat!

<activity_description>: string describing the content of the activity; other people involved should also be mentioned, (like "go to Gym to play basketball with Tyler Robinson");


**Reflection Interval Rules:**
- Work activities: ≥120 or "none"  
- Recreation: ≥60 or "none"
- Medical visits: "none"
- Last activity (go back home to sleep): "none"; don't interrupt sleep;
- All others: ≥20


**Daily Activity Structure Rules:**
1. On week days, agent needs to go to work or school during work hours! you'd better adhere to the working hours on work days
2. End: Return home before 22:00!
3. Chronological order required
4. One activity per facility per time period (merge related activities)
5. DO NOT plan to participant event that does not actually exists (not perceived)
6. When planning activities, be aware of the travel time and distance! For example, if you plan to go to Museum during work day noon break, you may not be able to complete the activity in time.


**Transportation Rules:**
- Can drive only if: has license AND family car available
- One car per driver - must return to where parked
- No abandoning vehicles mid-day
- Transit includes walking and metro


-----CONCEPTS GUIDELINES-----
"concepts" a list of concepts. You can also generate concepts (especially traffic related concepts) to be remembered in the long term memory (optional but recommended). Here "concept" means an idea or thought to be remembered. These memories will help you to make better future decisions.

Generate 0-5 concepts for long-term memory. Focus on:
- Recurring patterns (not one-time events); especially traffic related patterns
- Actionable insights for future planning
- Specific locations and time windows


**Content Types:**
- Traffic patterns: "Ave_3 consistently congested during morning commute"
- Facility patterns: "Gym less crowded after 19:00"
- Activity timing: "Client meetings often run 30 minutes over scheduled time"
- Coordination insights: "School pickup requires 15-minute buffer for parking"
DO NOT fabricate concepts; base patterns on your actual experiences.


**Required Format for each concept:**
[<content>, <keywords>, <spatial_scope>, <time_scope>]


**Field Definitions:**
<content>: a string; content of the concept;
<keywords>: a string composed of keywords separated by comma, like "Gym, crowded, 6PM";
<spatial_scope>: a string that describe the spatial scope related to the concept. It must be a list of entities separated by comma; an entity can be a link name, road name, facility name or maze name.
<time_scope>: time scope of the concept; it must be two time string separated by '-', like "11:00-13:30", and the time should be in 24-hour format. Do NOT include anything else in the time string (for example, "11:00PM-1:30PM", '2025-03-10 12:00-16:00', 'all-day' are not allowed)!


**Spatial Scope Options:**
- Specific link: e.g. "Ave_3_link_2"
- Road/Metro: e.g. "Ave_3", "Metro_2"  
- Facility: e.g. "Supermarket"
- Area: e.g. "Food court, Coffee shop"
- Whole network: "the town"

-----CONTEXT-----
Current time: Thu 2025-03-13 07:30

The original activity plan and reflection of Michael Chen at the start of today:
---TODAY ORIGINAL ACTIVITY PLAN SECTION START---
Reflection: Yesterday's experiences reinforced the importance of flexibility and communication in navigating transit challenges. The unexpected congestion on St_1_link_2 during the evening commute highlighted the need for real-time adjustments, which were made possible through coordination with Sarah and James. My reliance on Metro_2 proved effective during peak hours, particularly in the morning when Ave_1_link_1 experienced typical early delays. Joint trips, such as the lunchtime visit to Supermarket with Sarah, not only reduced redundant travel but also optimized time usage. Looking ahead, I plan to refine my morning route to avoid known bottlenecks and continue leveraging public transit for efficiency. This week has been productive at the Museum, where preparations for the upcoming exhibit are on track. I also aim to maintain a healthy balance by attending the Gym more regularly and participating in social activities like the book club with James Wilson.
Original daily activity plan:
[['Uptown apartment', '06:45', 20, 'none', 'none', 'Wake up at home and complete his morning routine.'], ['Coffee shop', '07:30', 20, 'transit', 'Metro_2', 'Takes Metro_2 from Node_1 to Node_11 to grab coffee before heading to work.'], ['Museum', '08:10', 120, 'transit', 'Metro_2_link_3', 'Continues via Metro_2 to Node_6 and walks to Museum for full day of curation and preparation for upcoming exhibits.'], ['Supermarket', '12:30', 60, 'drive', 'St_3_link_1', 'Drives from Museum to Supermarket during lunch break to restock household essentials.'], ['Office', '13:15', 120, 'drive', 'Ave_2_link_3, St_4_link_1', 'Meets with Gloria Campbell at Office to finalize exhibit designs; driving ensures punctuality and safe transport of materials.'], ['Gym', '17:45', 60, 'transit', 'Metro_1_link_4, Metro_1_link_5', 'After work, takes Metro_1 from Node_8 to Node_3 and transfers to Node_13 to go to Gym for light training and relaxation.'], ['Uptown apartment', '19:30', 'none', 'transit', 'Metro_2_link_3, Metro_2_link_2, Metro_2_link_1', 'Returns home via Metro_2 to Node_1 and spends quiet evening with family before bedtime.']]
---TODAY ORIGINAL ACTIVITY PLAN SECTION END---


The person may have revised activity plan for today. Revisions as well as reflections are listed below (empty if no revision has happened yet):
---TODAY ACTIVITY PLAN REVISIONS SECTION START---


Time: 07:15
Reflections: 
Current traffic conditions show moderate congestion on St_1_link_1 and St_1_link_2, with light congestion on St_2_link_2. Sarah is currently commuting to the Hospital via St_2_link_1 and will encounter some delays. Gloria is en route to Factory through Ave_4_link_1 and St_4_link_2 without significant waiting time. Since I'm still at home preparing for the day, I can adjust my departure time or path to avoid potential congestion on Metro_2 links that may arise as morning commute intensifies.
Plan revisions: Michael Chen update current path to real-time shortest

-----IMPORTANT NOTES-----
1. Be flexible about activity plan and travel decisions! Also, be aware that changing plans too frequently may cause inconvenience to yourself and other people! avoid unnecessary revisions!
2. Your newly revised plan should be in accord with your previous reflections and chats with other people!
3. We focus on personal movements on the network; it's not necessary to consider the details of the activities; actions in the same facility for a contiguous time interval should be merged into one activity.
4. You should NOT regard movement on the network as a separate activity! For example, you should not have two activities like "Drive to work place" and "Work at the work place" with the same <activity_facility>. Merge them into one activity as "Drive to work place and start to work"!
5. Travel mode is decided at the start of the day and fixed for the whole day! Do NOT change the travel mode during the day!
6. Stay at work facility during work hours on weekdays.
7. The activity plan should be generated based on the person's daily routine and preferences, family needs, as well as social needs.
8. When planning for activities, be aware of the travel time between locations! 
9. Review the current activity plan for potential issues, such as missing activities (e.g., forgetting to return to the workplace after a lunch break, forgetting to pick up kids from School in the evening if you dropped off the kid in the morning), incorrect facility names (!), or the final activity not being a return home. Revise the plan as necessary to address any identified problems！！
10. Person names, facility names, link names, road names, etc. should all be valid names (case sensitive).
