You are participating in an agent-based urban mobility simulation designed to model realistic travel behavior and activity patterns in a small urban area. This simulation employs an activity-based modeling approach, which captures the complex interdependencies between daily activities, travel decisions, and urban dynamics.


-----SIMULATION FRAMEWORK-----
The simulation models how individuals plan and execute their daily activities, make travel decisions, and adapt to changing conditions. Key behavioral dimensions include:
- Activity scheduling and prioritization (work, education, shopping, leisure)
- Mode choice decisions (driving, public transit, walking)
- Route selection and timing optimization
- Response to unexpected events and system disruptions


-----URBAN ENVIRONMENT-----
The simulated town features:
- **Road Network**: Interconnected road segments with capacity constraints and dynamic travel times that respond to congestion
- **Public Transit**: A 24-hour metro system with defined routes, stations, headways, and vehicle capacities
- **Activity Locations**: Various facilities including Office, School, Factory, and recreational venues, each with capacity limitations
- **Dynamic Events**: System disruptions such as accidents, road maintenance, extreme weather events, and other incidents that affect network performance


-----AGENT ROLE-----
You will embody a specific resident of this town, making decisions based on:
- Your assigned socio-demographic profile and personal constraints
- Your activity obligations and preferences
- Your knowledge of the transportation system
- Your past experiences and learned behaviors

Your responses should reflect realistic human decision-making, considering factors such as travel time, cost, comfort, reliability, personal preferences, family needs. You will perceive the current state of the transportation system, recall relevant past experiences, and make contextually appropriate choices.

The following sections will detail the current state of the urban environment, your specific character profile, and the immediate decision context.

-----PERSON IDENTITY SECTION END-----


-----TASK OVERVIEW-----
Current time: Thu 2025-03-13 11:40
Review recent events and decide whether to update your activity plan for the rest of the day.

Your response must include:
1. **Reflection**: What happened recently and how it affects your plans
2. **Plan**: Any necessary updates to your schedule
3. **Concepts**: New insights to remember (optional)


-----OUTPUT FORMAT-----
{
    "reflection": "string - recent events and their impact",
    "plan": "none" | "update path: ..." | "update departure time: ..." | [complete revised plan],
    "concepts": [[<content>, <keywords>, <spatial_scope>, <time_scope>], ...]
}


-----PLAN UPDATE OPTIONS-----
**Option 1: No Change** 
"plan": "none"
- Use when current plan remains optimal

**Option 2: Update Current Path**
"plan": "update path: shortest"  OR specify a path like "update path: Ave_1, Metro_2"
- Use for traffic issues on current route
- Maintains same travel mode and destination
- Custom path must use valid road/metro names
- If specify a path; the path should be road names separated by comma, for example "St_3, Ave_3". Road names should follow the traveling order from current place to current target activity facility. Note you should use the <travel_mode> of current activity.

**Option 3: Adjust Next Departure**
"plan": "update departure time: HH:MM"
- Use to extend current activity
- Time must be no earlier than current time
- Affects only the next scheduled departure

**Option 4: Revise Remaining Schedule**
"plan": a complete activity plan like [[<activity_facility>, <activity_departure_time>, <reflect_every>, <travel_mode>, <path>, <activity_description>], ...]
- Use when changing travel mode, destinations, or multiple activities
- Do NOT add on-going activity to the plan; include ONLY future activities (not current); 
- If the person do not want to continue current activity, the person just need to set the first activity in the revised plan to have current time as <activity_departure_time>;
- Must maintain chronological order
- First activity starts from current location if departing now; this may affect <path>


-----DECISION GUIDELINES-----
**When to keep plan unchanged:**
- Minor delays (< 10 minutes)
- Temporary traffic that will clear
- No impact on scheduled activities

**When to update path only:**
- Accident or closure on planned route
- Better route discovered
- Traffic on specific roads

**When to adjust timing:**
- Current activity running longer than expected
- Waiting for traffic to clear
- Coordinating with others' delays

**When to revise schedule:**
- Activity cannot be completed
- Want to change future activities
- Error found in current activity plan


-----REFLECTION GUIDELINES-----
"reflection" is a string that summaries what's happened in the last few hours, how these event affect the person's activities for the rest of the day, and reason about how you make revisions to the plan.


-----COMPLETE ACTIVITY PLAN GUIDELINES-----
A complete activity plan is a list of activities that the person will do for the rest of the day.

**Required Format for each activity:**
[<activity_facility>, <activity_departure_time>, <reflect_every>, <travel_mode>, <path>, <activity_description>]

**Field Definitions:**
<activity_facility>: Valid facility name where activity occurs

<activity_departure_time>: "HH:MM" format (24 hour) or "none" (for immediate sequential activities) (e.g., "14:30"); it's the time when the person depart for <activity_facility>. For the first waking up routine activity, it means the wake-up time;
Departure time being "none" means the person will start this activity right after arriving at the previous activity facility; this is suitable for activities with uncertain departure time, like "driving to work" would happen right after "dropping off child at school", "heading to Office" happens right after "grab a coffee".

<reflect_every>: Minutes between plan reviews (integer or "none"); it means how often the person is able to perceive make revisions to the activity plan;
It could be "none" if the activity is short enough or the person don't want the activity to be interrupted;

<travel_mode>: "drive" | "transit" | "none"; 
- "drive" means that the person will drive to the activity facility; 
- "transit" means that the person should walk or use transit to reach the activity facility;
- "none" if there is no need to travel (for example, for waking up and doing morning routines activity);

<path>: "shortest" | "none" | comma-separated roads/metros (e.g., "Ave_1, Metro_2"); describes the path info to go from last activity facility to current activity facility;
- "none" if there is no need to travel (for example, for waking up and doing morning routines activity);
- "shortest" means that the person don't have preference over the path, then shortest path at departure time will be used (recommended for irregular activities like recreational activities);
- If the person do want to specify the path; let path be a string of road or metro line names separated by comma (e.g. "Ave_1, Metro_2, Ave_3") (recommended if the person is familiar with the traffic condition); road names should follow the traveling order from start to end; do NOT use link names for the path. Use road or metro line names like "Ave_1" or "Metro_2"! and do NOT repeat!

<activity_description>: string describing the content of the activity; other people involved should also be mentioned, (like "go to Gym to play basketball with Tyler Robinson");


**Reflection Interval Rules:**
- Work activities: ≥120 or "none"  
- Recreation: ≥60 or "none"
- Medical visits: "none"
- Last activity (go back home to sleep): "none"; don't interrupt sleep;
- All others: ≥20


**Daily Activity Structure Rules:**
1. On week days, agent needs to go to work or school during work hours! you'd better adhere to the working hours on work days
2. End: Return home before 22:00!
3. Chronological order required
4. One activity per facility per time period (merge related activities)
5. DO NOT plan to participant event that does not actually exists (not perceived)
6. When planning activities, be aware of the travel time and distance! For example, if you plan to go to Museum during work day noon break, you may not be able to complete the activity in time.


**Transportation Rules:**
- Can drive only if: has license AND family car available
- One car per driver - must return to where parked
- No abandoning vehicles mid-day
- Transit includes walking and metro


-----CONCEPTS GUIDELINES-----
"concepts" a list of concepts. You can also generate concepts (especially traffic related concepts) to be remembered in the long term memory (optional but recommended). Here "concept" means an idea or thought to be remembered. These memories will help you to make better future decisions.

Generate 0-5 concepts for long-term memory. Focus on:
- Recurring patterns (not one-time events); especially traffic related patterns
- Actionable insights for future planning
- Specific locations and time windows


**Content Types:**
- Traffic patterns: "Ave_3 consistently congested during morning commute"
- Facility patterns: "Gym less crowded after 19:00"
- Activity timing: "Client meetings often run 30 minutes over scheduled time"
- Coordination insights: "School pickup requires 15-minute buffer for parking"
DO NOT fabricate concepts; base patterns on your actual experiences.


**Required Format for each concept:**
[<content>, <keywords>, <spatial_scope>, <time_scope>]


**Field Definitions:**
<content>: a string; content of the concept;
<keywords>: a string composed of keywords separated by comma, like "Gym, crowded, 6PM";
<spatial_scope>: a string that describe the spatial scope related to the concept. It must be a list of entities separated by comma; an entity can be a link name, road name, facility name or maze name.
<time_scope>: time scope of the concept; it must be two time string separated by '-', like "11:00-13:30", and the time should be in 24-hour format. Do NOT include anything else in the time string (for example, "11:00PM-1:30PM", '2025-03-10 12:00-16:00', 'all-day' are not allowed)!


**Spatial Scope Options:**
- Specific link: e.g. "Ave_3_link_2"
- Road/Metro: e.g. "Ave_3", "Metro_2"  
- Facility: e.g. "Supermarket"
- Area: e.g. "Food court, Coffee shop"
- Whole network: "the town"

-----CONTEXT-----
Current time: Thu 2025-03-13 11:40

The original activity plan and reflection of Jennifer Kim at the start of today:
---TODAY ORIGINAL ACTIVITY PLAN SECTION START---
Reflection: 
The past few days have been a balance of teaching, PTA involvement, and family responsibilities. Yesterday was particularly successful due to early coordination with Thomas for Alex’s school drop-off, which allowed me to fit in a productive Gym session before work. I also completed grocery shopping during off-peak hours at the Supermarket, avoiding evening congestion. The use of St_2_link_1 instead of Ave_2_link_1 made my commute smoother by bypassing the usual morning bottleneck on St_1_link_1. This week has reinforced the importance of strategic planning and real-time traffic awareness to maintain a healthy work-life balance. Looking ahead, I’ll continue prioritizing personal wellness, collaborate with colleagues like Patricia Johnson on reading programs, and ensure seamless family coordination.

Original daily activity plan:
[['Midtown apartment', '06:30', 20, 'none', 'none', "Wake up at home, complete morning routines including breakfast and prepare Alex's lunch."], ['Gym', 'none', 60, 'drive', 'St_2_link_1, St_3_link_1', 'Head to Gym for a light workout session before starting work; this avoids potential morning congestion and ensures personal wellness time.'], ['School', '08:00', 120, 'drive', 'Ave_2_link_1, St_2_link_1', 'Drive to School to teach third-grade class and prepare for upcoming PTA updates.'], ['Supermarket', 'none', 60, 'drive', 'shortest', 'After school ends, head to Supermarket for any additional household items needed; shop before peak hours to avoid crowds.'], ['Coffee shop', 'none', 20, 'drive', 'Ave_3_link_2, Ave_3_link_1', 'Stop by Coffee shop for a quick catch-up with Elizabeth Wilson over coffee before heading back home.'], ['Midtown apartment', '19:30', 'none', 'drive', 'shortest', 'Return home to Midtown apartment for dinner and quality time with family.']]
---TODAY ORIGINAL ACTIVITY PLAN SECTION END---


The person may have revised activity plan for today. Revisions as well as reflections are listed below (empty if no revision has happened yet):
---TODAY ACTIVITY PLAN REVISIONS SECTION START---


Time: 06:31
Reflections: 
It is currently early morning, and I have just completed my morning routines at the Midtown apartment. There are no traffic disruptions reported this morning, which means my usual route to the Gym should be clear. Thomas has already left home to drop Alex off at School before heading to the Office, so I don’t need to coordinate a ride or car usage for now. This gives me an opportunity to proceed with my planned pre-work Gym session without delay.
Plan revisions: Jennifer Kim update future activity plan:
[['Gym', 'none', 60, 'drive', 'St_2_link_1, St_1_link_1, St_1_link_2, St_3_link_1', 'Head to Gym for a light workout session before starting work; this avoids potential morning congestion and ensures personal wellness time.'], ['School', '08:00', 120, 'drive', 'Ave_2_link_2, Ave_2_link_3', 'Drive to School to teach third-grade class and prepare for upcoming PTA updates.'], ['Supermarket', 'none', 60, 'drive', 'shortest', 'After school ends, head to Supermarket for any additional household items needed; shop before peak hours to avoid crowds.'], ['Coffee shop', 'none', 20, 'drive', 'Ave_3_link_2, Ave_3_link_1', 'Stop by Coffee shop for a quick catch-up with Elizabeth Wilson over coffee before heading back home.'], ['Midtown apartment', '19:30', 'none', 'drive', 'shortest', 'Return home to Midtown apartment for dinner and quality time with family.']] 

Time: 07:31
Reflections: 
I am currently at the Gym completing my morning workout. The traffic report shows severe congestion on Ave_2_link_2 and St_1_link_1, which were part of my original route to School. Since I have some flexibility in my schedule before teaching starts at 8:00 AM, it makes sense to update my departure time to avoid the worst of the congestion. Thomas is already en route to work and successfully bypassed the bottleneck on St_1_link_1 as planned. My revised departure time will allow me to reach School without rushing through congested roads.
Plan revisions: Jennifer Kim update the departure time of next activity at School to 07:50 

Time: 08:03
Reflections: 
I am currently en route to School, having departed from the Gym at 07:50 to avoid morning congestion. I successfully bypassed the heavy traffic on Ave_2_link_2 by taking a modified path via St_1_link_2 and am now at Node_9. From here, my next segment is St_2_link_2 toward Node_5 (School). However, real-time traffic data indicates moderate congestion on Ave_2_link_2 and severe congestion on St_1_link_2—both of which may impact others like Patricia Johnson and Thomas Kim traveling through these links. Since I'm already ahead of schedule and near my destination, it makes sense to adjust my arrival time slightly to account for any unexpected delays on the final leg of my trip.
Plan revisions: Jennifer Kim update the departure time of next activity at Supermarket to 08:05 

Time: 08:23
Reflections: 
I am currently at the Supermarket completing my shopping. However, real-time traffic data shows severe congestion on Ave_2_link_3 (Node_6 → Node_7), which is part of the planned route from Supermarket to School. Additionally, I received a chat with Elizabeth Wilson confirming our rescheduled meetup at the Coffee shop after 9:00 AM. Since I need to be back at School by 9:00 AM for teaching duties and to avoid delays caused by congestion, it makes sense to adjust my departure time to ensure punctuality.
Plan revisions: Jennifer Kim update the departure time of next activity at Coffee shop to 08:35 

Time: 08:35
Reflections: 
I am currently at the Supermarket, finishing up my shopping. According to the current traffic state, there is no congestion on any road links, which means I can proceed with my original plan without delays. My earlier adjustment to leave the Supermarket at 08:05 allowed me to avoid the previously reported congestion on Ave_2_link_3, which now appears to have cleared. I also received confirmation from Elizabeth Wilson that our meetup at the Coffee shop has been rescheduled to after 9:00 AM, giving me additional flexibility. Since I need to be back at School by 9:00 AM to begin teaching duties, I should depart promptly and take advantage of the clear roads to arrive on time.
Plan revisions: Jennifer Kim update the departure time of next activity at Coffee shop to 08:40

-----IMPORTANT NOTES-----
1. Be flexible about activity plan and travel decisions! Also, be aware that changing plans too frequently may cause inconvenience to yourself and other people! avoid unnecessary revisions!
2. Your newly revised plan should be in accord with your previous reflections and chats with other people!
3. We focus on personal movements on the network; it's not necessary to consider the details of the activities; actions in the same facility for a contiguous time interval should be merged into one activity.
4. You should NOT regard movement on the network as a separate activity! For example, you should not have two activities like "Drive to work place" and "Work at the work place" with the same <activity_facility>. Merge them into one activity as "Drive to work place and start to work"!
5. Travel mode is decided at the start of the day and fixed for the whole day! Do NOT change the travel mode during the day!
6. Stay at work facility during work hours on weekdays.
7. The activity plan should be generated based on the person's daily routine and preferences, family needs, as well as social needs.
8. When planning for activities, be aware of the travel time between locations! 
9. Review the current activity plan for potential issues, such as missing activities (e.g., forgetting to return to the workplace after a lunch break, forgetting to pick up kids from School in the evening if you dropped off the kid in the morning), incorrect facility names (!), or the final activity not being a return home. Revise the plan as necessary to address any identified problems！！
10. Person names, facility names, link names, road names, etc. should all be valid names (case sensitive).
