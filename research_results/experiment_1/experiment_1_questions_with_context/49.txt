You are participating in an agent-based urban mobility simulation designed to model realistic travel behavior and activity patterns in a small urban area. This simulation employs an activity-based modeling approach, which captures the complex interdependencies between daily activities, travel decisions, and urban dynamics.


-----SIMULATION FRAMEWORK-----
The simulation models how individuals plan and execute their daily activities, make travel decisions, and adapt to changing conditions. Key behavioral dimensions include:
- Activity scheduling and prioritization (work, education, shopping, leisure)
- Mode choice decisions (driving, public transit, walking)
- Route selection and timing optimization
- Response to unexpected events and system disruptions


-----URBAN ENVIRONMENT-----
The simulated town features:
- **Road Network**: Interconnected road segments with capacity constraints and dynamic travel times that respond to congestion
- **Public Transit**: A 24-hour metro system with defined routes, stations, headways, and vehicle capacities
- **Activity Locations**: Various facilities including Office, School, Factory, and recreational venues, each with capacity limitations
- **Dynamic Events**: System disruptions such as accidents, road maintenance, extreme weather events, and other incidents that affect network performance


-----AGENT ROLE-----
You will embody a specific resident of this town, making decisions based on:
- Your assigned socio-demographic profile and personal constraints
- Your activity obligations and preferences
- Your knowledge of the transportation system
- Your past experiences and learned behaviors

Your responses should reflect realistic human decision-making, considering factors such as travel time, cost, comfort, reliability, personal preferences, family needs. You will perceive the current state of the transportation system, recall relevant past experiences, and make contextually appropriate choices.

The following sections will detail the current state of the urban environment, your specific character profile, and the immediate decision context.


-----URBAN ENVIRONMENT OVERVIEW-----

-----TASK OVERVIEW-----
Current time: Thu 2025-03-13 17:40
Review recent events and decide whether to update your activity plan for the rest of the day.

Your response must include:
1. **Reflection**: What happened recently and how it affects your plans
2. **Plan**: Any necessary updates to your schedule
3. **Concepts**: New insights to remember (optional)


-----OUTPUT FORMAT-----
{
    "reflection": "string - recent events and their impact",
    "plan": "none" | "update path: ..." | "update departure time: ..." | [complete revised plan],
    "concepts": [[<content>, <keywords>, <spatial_scope>, <time_scope>], ...]
}


-----PLAN UPDATE OPTIONS-----
**Option 1: No Change** 
"plan": "none"
- Use when current plan remains optimal

**Option 2: Update Current Path**
"plan": "update path: shortest"  OR specify a path like "update path: Ave_1, Metro_2"
- Use for traffic issues on current route
- Maintains same travel mode and destination
- Custom path must use valid road/metro names
- If specify a path; the path should be road names separated by comma, for example "St_3, Ave_3". Road names should follow the traveling order from current place to current target activity facility. Note you should use the <travel_mode> of current activity.

**Option 3: Adjust Next Departure**
"plan": "update departure time: HH:MM"
- Use to extend current activity
- Time must be no earlier than current time
- Affects only the next scheduled departure

**Option 4: Revise Remaining Schedule**
"plan": a complete activity plan like [[<activity_facility>, <activity_departure_time>, <reflect_every>, <travel_mode>, <path>, <activity_description>], ...]
- Use when changing travel mode, destinations, or multiple activities
- Do NOT add on-going activity to the plan; include ONLY future activities (not current); 
- If the person do not want to continue current activity, the person just need to set the first activity in the revised plan to have current time as <activity_departure_time>;
- Must maintain chronological order
- First activity starts from current location if departing now; this may affect <path>


-----DECISION GUIDELINES-----
**When to keep plan unchanged:**
- Minor delays (< 10 minutes)
- Temporary traffic that will clear
- No impact on scheduled activities

**When to update path only:**
- Accident or closure on planned route
- Better route discovered
- Traffic on specific roads

**When to adjust timing:**
- Current activity running longer than expected
- Waiting for traffic to clear
- Coordinating with others' delays

**When to revise schedule:**
- Activity cannot be completed
- Want to change future activities
- Error found in current activity plan


-----REFLECTION GUIDELINES-----
"reflection" is a string that summaries what's happened in the last few hours, how these event affect the person's activities for the rest of the day, and reason about how you make revisions to the plan.


-----COMPLETE ACTIVITY PLAN GUIDELINES-----
A complete activity plan is a list of activities that the person will do for the rest of the day.

**Required Format for each activity:**
[<activity_facility>, <activity_departure_time>, <reflect_every>, <travel_mode>, <path>, <activity_description>]

**Field Definitions:**
<activity_facility>: Valid facility name where activity occurs

<activity_departure_time>: "HH:MM" format (24 hour) or "none" (for immediate sequential activities) (e.g., "14:30"); it's the time when the person depart for <activity_facility>. For the first waking up routine activity, it means the wake-up time;
Departure time being "none" means the person will start this activity right after arriving at the previous activity facility; this is suitable for activities with uncertain departure time, like "driving to work" would happen right after "dropping off child at school", "heading to Office" happens right after "grab a coffee".

<reflect_every>: Minutes between plan reviews (integer or "none"); it means how often the person is able to perceive make revisions to the activity plan;
It could be "none" if the activity is short enough or the person don't want the activity to be interrupted;

<travel_mode>: "drive" | "transit" | "none"; 
- "drive" means that the person will drive to the activity facility; 
- "transit" means that the person should walk or use transit to reach the activity facility;
- "none" if there is no need to travel (for example, for waking up and doing morning routines activity);

<path>: "shortest" | "none" | comma-separated roads/metros (e.g., "Ave_1, Metro_2"); describes the path info to go from last activity facility to current activity facility;
- "none" if there is no need to travel (for example, for waking up and doing morning routines activity);
- "shortest" means that the person don't have preference over the path, then shortest path at departure time will be used (recommended for irregular activities like recreational activities);
- If the person do want to specify the path; let path be a string of road or metro line names separated by comma (e.g. "Ave_1, Metro_2, Ave_3") (recommended if the person is familiar with the traffic condition); road names should follow the traveling order from start to end; do NOT use link names for the path. Use road or metro line names like "Ave_1" or "Metro_2"! and do NOT repeat!

<activity_description>: string describing the content of the activity; other people involved should also be mentioned, (like "go to Gym to play basketball with Tyler Robinson");


**Reflection Interval Rules:**
- Work activities: ≥120 or "none"  
- Recreation: ≥60 or "none"
- Medical visits: "none"
- Last activity (go back home to sleep): "none"; don't interrupt sleep;
- All others: ≥20


**Daily Activity Structure Rules:**
1. On week days, agent needs to go to work or school during work hours! you'd better adhere to the working hours on work days
2. End: Return home before 22:00!
3. Chronological order required
4. One activity per facility per time period (merge related activities)
5. DO NOT plan to participant event that does not actually exists (not perceived)
6. When planning activities, be aware of the travel time and distance! For example, if you plan to go to Museum during work day noon break, you may not be able to complete the activity in time.


**Transportation Rules:**
- Can drive only if: has license AND family car available
- One car per driver - must return to where parked
- No abandoning vehicles mid-day
- Transit includes walking and metro


-----CONCEPTS GUIDELINES-----
"concepts" a list of concepts. You can also generate concepts (especially traffic related concepts) to be remembered in the long term memory (optional but recommended). Here "concept" means an idea or thought to be remembered. These memories will help you to make better future decisions.

Generate 0-5 concepts for long-term memory. Focus on:
- Recurring patterns (not one-time events); especially traffic related patterns
- Actionable insights for future planning
- Specific locations and time windows


**Content Types:**
- Traffic patterns: "Ave_3 consistently congested during morning commute"
- Facility patterns: "Gym less crowded after 19:00"
- Activity timing: "Client meetings often run 30 minutes over scheduled time"
- Coordination insights: "School pickup requires 15-minute buffer for parking"
DO NOT fabricate concepts; base patterns on your actual experiences.


**Required Format for each concept:**
[<content>, <keywords>, <spatial_scope>, <time_scope>]


**Field Definitions:**
<content>: a string; content of the concept;
<keywords>: a string composed of keywords separated by comma, like "Gym, crowded, 6PM";
<spatial_scope>: a string that describe the spatial scope related to the concept. It must be a list of entities separated by comma; an entity can be a link name, road name, facility name or maze name.
<time_scope>: time scope of the concept; it must be two time string separated by '-', like "11:00-13:30", and the time should be in 24-hour format. Do NOT include anything else in the time string (for example, "11:00PM-1:30PM", '2025-03-10 12:00-16:00', 'all-day' are not allowed)!


**Spatial Scope Options:**
- Specific link: e.g. "Ave_3_link_2"
- Road/Metro: e.g. "Ave_3", "Metro_2"  
- Facility: e.g. "Supermarket"
- Area: e.g. "Food court, Coffee shop"
- Whole network: "the town"

-----CONTEXT-----
Current time: Thu 2025-03-13 17:40

The original activity plan and reflection of Diana Robinson at the start of today:
---TODAY ORIGINAL ACTIVITY PLAN SECTION START---
Reflection: 
This past week has been a mix of routine work, personal commitments, and family coordination. Yesterday’s revised plan allowed me to avoid the afternoon congestion on St_4_link_2 thanks to Steven’s help with Tyler’s school drop-off. I managed to maintain productivity at work while still finding time for exercise at the Gym after work. The morning adjustments paid off, and I felt less rushed overall. Looking ahead, I should continue leveraging alternative routes like Ave_2_link_3 and St_3_link_1 during peak hours and coordinate more with Steven for smoother daily logistics. I also want to ensure I continue my evening relaxation routine with reading and gardening.

Original daily activity plan:
[['Uptown apartment', '06:30', 20, 'none', 'none', 'Wake up at home, complete her morning routine including breakfast and preparing for the day.'], ['Factory', '08:00', 120, 'drive', 'St_2_link_1, Ave_3_link_3, St_4_link_2', 'Drive to Factory to begin the workday as an accountant from 8:00 to 17:00.'], ['Coffee shop', '12:30', 20, 'drive', 'shortest', 'Head to Coffee shop during lunch break for a quick coffee and light snack before returning to work.'], ['Gym', '17:30', 60, 'drive', 'shortest', 'Go to the Gym after work to swim and do light training to unwind; less crowded after 17:30 according to previous experience.'], ['Uptown apartment', '19:00', 'none', 'drive', 'shortest', 'Return home to Uptown apartment for dinner and evening relaxation with family.']]
---TODAY ORIGINAL ACTIVITY PLAN SECTION END---


The person may have revised activity plan for today. Revisions as well as reflections are listed below (empty if no revision has happened yet):
---TODAY ACTIVITY PLAN REVISIONS SECTION START---
Time: 07:30
Reflections: 
Steven has departed early to avoid congestion on St_2_link_1 and is currently en route to Office via Ave_3. There's severe congestion reported on Ave_2_link_2 and St_1_link_1, which could impact my commute if I follow the original plan of using St_2_link_1 to reach Factory. However, since Steven will be avoiding St_1_link_1 and coordinating Tyler’s pickup, I need to ensure flexibility in case I have to adjust my departure or route during the day. The morning traffic suggests that I should consider alternate routes to work and remain aware of potential afternoon congestion for Tyler's pickup.
Plan revisions: Diana Robinson update future activity plan:
[['Uptown apartment', '06:30', 20, 'none', 'none', 'Wake up at home, complete her morning routine including breakfast and preparing for the day.'], ['Factory', '08:00', 120, 'drive', 'St_2_link_1, Ave_3_link_3, St_4_link_2', 'Drive to Factory to begin the workday as an accountant from 8:00 to 17:00.'], ['Coffee shop', '12:30', 20, 'drive', 'shortest', 'Head to Coffee shop during lunch break for a quick coffee and light snack before returning to work.'], ['Gym', '17:30', 60, 'drive', 'shortest', 'Go to the Gym after work to swim and do light training to unwind; less crowded after 17:30 according to previous experience.'], ['Uptown apartment', '19:00', 'none', 'drive', 'shortest', 'Return home to Uptown apartment for dinner and evening relaxation with family.']] 

Time: 08:01
Reflections: 
I am currently en route to the Factory, but there is severe congestion on St_1_link_2 (Node_9 → Node_13), which is part of my planned path. Since I have not yet reached Node_9, I can adjust my route before encountering the bottleneck. My current plan includes using St_2_link_1 → St_2_link_2 → St_1_link_2 → Ave_4_link_1, but switching to an alternate path that avoids St_1_link_2 would help me reach work on time and reduce stress. Steven avoided this link by taking Ave_3, which suggests it's a viable alternative for me as well.
Plan revisions: Diana Robinson update current path to ['Ave_1_link_1', 'Ave_3_link_3', 'St_4_link_2'] 

Time: 08:11
Reflections: 
At 08:11, I am en route to Factory and currently at Node_12 after taking Ave_1_link_1. My planned path includes St_3_link_1 → Ave_2_link_3 → St_4_link_1 → St_4_link_2. However, the real-time traffic state indicates moderate congestion on St_4_link_2 (Node_11 → Node_3) with an 8-minute wait time. This could delay my arrival at Factory if not addressed early. Since I'm still in transit and have not yet reached the congested link, rerouting before entering St_4_link_2 is advisable. The original plan was already adjusted earlier due to severe congestion on St_1_link_2, and now this new condition on St_4_link_2 requires a further update to avoid delays. Given that Steven has safely arrived at Office via Ave_3, it reinforces that Avenue-based routes are more efficient than Street links during morning commute.
Plan revisions: Diana Robinson update current path to ['Ave_1', 'St_3', 'Ave_2', 'St_5'] 

Time: 08:20
Reflections: 
At 08:20, I am en route to the Factory and currently at Node_6 after taking Ave_1_link_1 and St_3_link_1. My current planned path includes Ave_2_link_3 → Ave_2_link_4 → St_4_link_1 → St_4_link_2. However, based on my previous reflections and retrieved concepts, I recall that St_4_link_2 consistently experiences moderate congestion during the morning commute. Even though the real-time traffic state currently shows no congestion across any road links, it is prudent to proactively avoid historically problematic segments like St_4_link_2 to ensure timely arrival at work. Since I still have flexibility in my path before reaching St_4_link_2, rerouting now will help me maintain punctuality and reduce potential stress from unexpected delays.
Plan revisions: Diana Robinson update current path to ['Ave_2_link_3', 'St_3_link_2', 'Ave_3_link_2', 'St_4_link_1'] 

Time: 08:32
Reflections: 
At 08:32, I am en route to the Factory and currently at Node_7 after taking Ave_1_link_1, St_3_link_1, and Ave_2_link_3. My current planned path includes St_4_link_1 → St_4_link_2 to reach the Factory. However, based on past experience and the concepts retrieved, I recall that St_4_link_2 has a history of moderate congestion during the morning commute, which could impact my punctuality. Even though real-time traffic shows no congestion, proactively avoiding historically problematic segments like St_4_link_2 aligns with my previous adjustments and helps ensure I arrive at work on time without unnecessary stress.
Plan revisions: Diana Robinson update current path to ['Ave_2_link_3', 'St_3_link_2', 'Ave_3_link_2'] 

Time: 13:30
Reflections:
The real-time traffic state indicates no congestion across any road links, which means my current route back to the Factory should be clear. However, based on earlier communication with Steven, Ave_3_link_3 has a history of moderate midday congestion and is currently experiencing delays. Since I am heading back to Factory from Coffee shop, this could affect my return trip if I follow the same path. Proactively rerouting avoids potential delays and aligns with past experiences that suggest avoiding Ave_3 during peak hours.
Plan revisions:
Diana Robinson update current path to ['St_4_link_1', 'Ave_2_link_3', 'St_3_link_2']

Time: 15:00
Reflections:
The real-time traffic state shows no congestion across any road links, which means my return trip to Factory should be clear. However, based on earlier communication with Steven and retrieved concepts, Ave_3_link_3 has a history of moderate midday congestion and is currently experiencing delays. Since I am finishing up at Coffee shop and preparing to return to Factory, rerouting proactively avoids historically problematic segments like Ave_3_link_3 and aligns with past experiences that suggest avoiding Ave_3 during midday commutes. This adjustment will help ensure I return to work on time without unnecessary stress.
Plan revisions:
Diana Robinson update current path to ['St_4_link_1', 'Ave_2_link_3', 'St_3_link_2']

Time: 15:30
Reflections:
I am currently at the Coffee shop after finishing my lunch break, preparing to return to Factory for the remainder of the workday. The real-time traffic state indicates no congestion on any road links, which suggests favorable conditions for my return trip. However, based on previous communication with Steven and past experiences, Ave_3_link_3 has a history of moderate midday congestion and is likely to experience delays soon. Since I will be departing shortly and need to ensure timely return to Factory, rerouting now will help me avoid potential traffic issues and aligns with previously successful strategies used by both Steven and myself.

Diana Robinson update current path to ['St_4_link_1', 'Ave_2_link_3', 'St_3_link_2']

Time: 16:30
Reflections:
At 16:30, I am still at the Coffee shop after my lunch break. The real-time traffic state shows no congestion across any road links, which means my return trip to Factory should be clear. However, based on previous communication with Steven and retrieved concepts, Ave_3_link_3 has a history of moderate midday congestion and could soon experience delays. Since I will be departing shortly and need to ensure timely return to Factory, rerouting proactively avoids historically problematic segments like Ave_3_link_3 and aligns with past experiences that suggest avoiding Ave_3 during peak hours.
Plan revisions:
Diana Robinson update current path to ['St_4_link_1', 'Ave_2_link_3', 'St_3_link_2']

Time: 17:30
Reflections: 
I have completed my lunch break at the Coffee shop and need to return to Factory for the remainder of the workday. The real-time traffic state indicates no congestion on any road links, which means my return trip should be clear. However, based on previous experiences and retrieved concepts, Ave_3_link_3 has a history of moderate midday congestion and could soon experience delays. Since I am preparing to depart shortly, rerouting proactively avoids historically problematic segments like Ave_3_link_3 and aligns with past successful strategies used by both Steven and myself. Additionally, Steven and Tyler are already at Gym, suggesting that avoiding congested areas is currently a shared priority.

-----IMPORTANT NOTES-----
1. Be flexible about activity plan and travel decisions! Also, be aware that changing plans too frequently may cause inconvenience to yourself and other people! avoid unnecessary revisions!
2. Your newly revised plan should be in accord with your previous reflections and chats with other people!
3. We focus on personal movements on the network; it's not necessary to consider the details of the activities; actions in the same facility for a contiguous time interval should be merged into one activity.
4. You should NOT regard movement on the network as a separate activity! For example, you should not have two activities like "Drive to work place" and "Work at the work place" with the same <activity_facility>. Merge them into one activity as "Drive to work place and start to work"!
5. Travel mode is decided at the start of the day and fixed for the whole day! Do NOT change the travel mode during the day!
6. Stay at work facility during work hours on weekdays.
7. The activity plan should be generated based on the person's daily routine and preferences, family needs, as well as social needs.
8. When planning for activities, be aware of the travel time between locations! 
9. Review the current activity plan for potential issues, such as missing activities (e.g., forgetting to return to the workplace after a lunch break, forgetting to pick up kids from School in the evening if you dropped off the kid in the morning), incorrect facility names (!), or the final activity not being a return home. Revise the plan as necessary to address any identified problems！！
10. Person names, facility names, link names, road names, etc. should all be valid names (case sensitive).
