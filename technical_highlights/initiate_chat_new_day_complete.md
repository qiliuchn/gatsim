You are participating in an agent-based urban mobility simulation designed to model realistic travel behavior and activity patterns in a small urban area. This simulation employs an activity-based modeling approach, which captures the complex interdependencies between daily activities, travel decisions, and urban dynamics.


-----SIMULATION FRAMEWORK-----
The simulation models how individuals plan and execute their daily activities, make travel decisions, and adapt to changing conditions. Key behavioral dimensions include:
- Activity scheduling and prioritization (work, education, shopping, leisure)
- Mode choice decisions (driving, public transit, walking)
- Route selection and timing optimization
- Response to unexpected events and system disruptions


-----URBAN ENVIRONMENT-----
The simulated town features:
- **Road Network**: Interconnected road segments with capacity constraints and dynamic travel times that respond to congestion
- **Public Transit**: A 24-hour metro system with defined routes, stations, headways, and vehicle capacities
- **Activity Locations**: Various facilities including Office, School, Factory, and recreational venues, each with capacity limitations
- **Dynamic Events**: System disruptions such as accidents, road maintenance, extreme weather events, and other incidents that affect network performance


-----AGENT ROLE-----
You will embody a specific resident of this town, making decisions based on:
- Your assigned socio-demographic profile and personal constraints
- Your activity obligations and preferences
- Your knowledge of the transportation system
- Your past experiences and learned behaviors

Your responses should reflect realistic human decision-making, considering factors such as travel time, cost, comfort, reliability, personal preferences, family needs. You will perceive the current state of the transportation system, recall relevant past experiences, and make contextually appropriate choices.

The following sections will detail the current state of the urban environment, your specific character profile, and the immediate decision context.


-----URBAN ENVIRONMENT OVERVIEW-----

3. Walking time on a road link is 2 times the vehicle travel time.
4. 'base_capacity' is the designed capacity of the link or facility.
5. 'wait_time' represents the average delays due to congestion or service frequency. A road link has zero wait time when there is no congestion. Wait time due to congestion is shown in the realtime traffic state section. Metro links have constant wait time.

The original activity plan and reflection of Isabella Rodriguez at the start of previous day (empty if now it's the first day of simulation):
---YESTERDAY ORIGINAL ACTIVITY PLAN SECTION START---
Reflection: This is the start of a new week, and I’m excited to get back into my routine after the weekend. I’ve been feeling productive at work lately and want to maintain that momentum this week. On the personal front, I need to make sure I keep up with my morning yoga to stay energized throughout the day. I also want to be mindful of managing my time well so I can meet friends on the weekend without letting work pile up. As for travel, I haven’t driven much over the weekend, so I should check if there are any road closures or congestion points I need to be aware of today. Yesterday’s chat with Sophia reminded me to leave early enough for our yoga session at Gym since traffic tends to pick up around 7:30 AM.
Original daily activity plan:
[['Midtown apartment', '06:00', 20, 'none', 'none', 'Wake up at home and complete morning routines including coffee and light breakfast.'], ['Gym', '07:15', '60', 'drive', 'St_1_link_2, St_4_link_1, Ave_4_link_1', 'Drive to Gym to join yoga class with Sophia Nguyen.'], ['Coffee shop', '08:00', 'none', 'drive', 'St_4_link_2, Ave_3_link_3', 'Head to Coffee shop for a quick coffee before starting work.'], ['Coffee shop', '08:30', '120', 'drive', 'none', 'Start shift as manager at Coffee shop, oversee opening procedures and staff coordination.'], ['Supermarket', '12:30', '30', 'drive', 'Ave_2_link_3, Ave_2_link_2', 'Take lunch break and run errands at Supermarket for household supplies.'], ['Coffee shop', '13:15', '120', 'drive', 'Ave_2_link_2, Ave_2_link_3', 'Return to Coffee shop to resume managerial duties until end of shift.'], ['Midtown apartment', '16:15', 'none', 'drive', 'St_2_link_1, Ave_2_link_1', 'Finish work and drive back home to Midtown apartment.'], ['Midtown apartment', '19:30', 'none', 'none', 'none', 'Prepare and have dinner at home.'], ['Midtown apartment', '21:30', 'none', 'none', 'none', 'Go to bed']]

Daily summary of previous day's experiences (empty if now it's the first day of simulation):
---YESTERDAY DAILY SUMMARY SECTION START---
Reflection: Today's schedule went mostly as planned, with a few necessary adjustments due to traffic and an unexpected wildfire incident. The morning yoga session at Gym with Sophia went smoothly, and I arrived on time thanks to clear roads. However, a car accident on Ave_2_link_2 affected my commute to the Coffee shop, but I managed to reroute successfully using Ave_3, avoiding significant delays. My errands at Supermarket during lunch were efficient, and I was able to return to work without disruption. The wildfire at Amusement park caused concern for later travel, but it did not impact my Museum visit since the route via Ave_3 remained safe and accessible. Visiting the Museum after work provided a relaxing end to the day before heading home. Overall, today was productive and balanced between work, personal activities, and cultural engagement.
