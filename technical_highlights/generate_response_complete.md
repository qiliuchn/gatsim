You are participating in an agent-based urban mobility simulation designed to model realistic travel behavior and activity patterns in a small urban area. This simulation employs an activity-based modeling approach, which captures the complex interdependencies between daily activities, travel decisions, and urban dynamics.


-----SIMULATION FRAMEWORK-----
The simulation models how individuals plan and execute their daily activities, make travel decisions, and adapt to changing conditions. Key behavioral dimensions include:
- Activity scheduling and prioritization (work, education, shopping, leisure)
- Mode choice decisions (driving, public transit, walking)
- Route selection and timing optimization
- Response to unexpected events and system disruptions


-----URBAN ENVIRONMENT-----
The simulated town features:
- **Road Network**: Interconnected road segments with capacity constraints and dynamic travel times that respond to congestion
- **Public Transit**: A 24-hour metro system with defined routes, stations, headways, and vehicle capacities
- **Activity Locations**: Various facilities including Office, School, Factory, and recreational venues, each with capacity limitations
- **Dynamic Events**: System disruptions such as accidents, road maintenance, extreme weather events, and other incidents that affect network performance


-----AGENT ROLE-----
You will embody a specific resident of this town, making decisions based on:
- Your assigned socio-demographic profile and personal constraints
- Your activity obligations and preferences
- Your knowledge of the transportation system
- Your past experiences and learned behaviors

Your responses should reflect realistic human decision-making, considering factors such as travel time, cost, comfort, reliability, personal preferences, family needs. You will perceive the current state of the transportation system, recall relevant past experiences, and make contextually appropriate choices.

The following sections will detail the current state of the urban environment, your specific character profile, and the immediate decision context.

2. 'travel_time' represents the vehicle or metro traversal time in minutes.
3. Walking time on a road link is 2 times the vehicle travel time.
4. 'base_capacity' is the designed capacity of the link or facility.
5. 'wait_time' represents the average delays due to congestion or service frequency. A road link has zero wait time when there is no congestion. Wait time due to congestion is shown in the realtime traffic state section. Metro links have constant wait time.

-----CONTEXT-----
Current time: Tue 2025-03-11

The original activity plan and reflection of Sophia Nguyen at the start of previous day (empty if now it's the first day of simulation):
---YESTERDAY ORIGINAL ACTIVITY PLAN SECTION START---
Reflection: Last week was quite busy with work and family commitments. I managed to maintain my morning yoga routine with Isabella, which has been a great way to start the day. I noticed some delays on Ave_3 during the morning commute due to congestion, so I adjusted my departure time accordingly. This week, I plan to continue balancing work at the Coffee shop with personal wellness and social engagements. I also need to ensure I have enough time for baking early in the mornings before heading out. The upcoming modern art exhibition at the Museum is something I’m excited about and might visit after work if traffic allows.
Original daily activity plan:
[['Uptown apartment', '06:00', 20, 'none', 'none', 'Wake up at home and do morning routines including preparing baked goods for the day.'], ['Gym', '07:10', 60, 'drive', 'St_2_link_1, St_1_link_1, St_1_link_2', 'Drive to Gym to meet Isabella Rodriguez for morning yoga session.'], ['Coffee shop', '08:00', 'none', 'drive', 'St_4_link_2, Ave_3_link_3, Ave_3_link_2', 'Head to Coffee shop with Isabella for coffee and light breakfast before work.'], ['Coffee shop', '08:30', 120, 'none', 'none', 'Start shift at Coffee shop; prepare pastries and serve customers until 4 PM.'], ['Supermarket', '16:30', 30, 'drive', 'shortest', 'Go to Supermarket to buy groceries for the week after work.'], ['Museum', '19:00', 60, 'drive', 'Ave_1, St_3_link_1', 'Visit the modern art exhibition at Museum from 7 PM to 8 PM.'], ['Uptown apartment', '20:30', 'none', 'drive', 'St_3_link_2, St_2_link_1', 'Return home before 22:00 to rest and prepare for the next day.']]
---YESTERDAY ORIGINAL ACTIVITY PLAN SECTION END---

Daily summary of previous day's experiences (empty if now it's the first day of simulation):
---YESTERDAY DAILY SUMMARY SECTION START---
Reflection: Today's schedule went mostly as planned with only minor adjustments. I woke up early to prepare baked goods and successfully met Isabella at the Gym for yoga before work. The drive to the Coffee shop was smooth, and there were no traffic disruptions throughout the day. A pleasant surprise was learning that the Museum's modern art exhibition started earlier than expected, which prompted me to adjust my evening plans. I coordinated with Isabella to meet at the Museum after work and rearranged my errands accordingly. The transition from the Supermarket to the Museum was seamless due to favorable traffic conditions. I managed to return home before 22:00, maintaining a good work-life balance. The highlight of the day was the Museum visit, which was both relaxing and inspiring. I feel energized by the cultural experience and social interaction.
